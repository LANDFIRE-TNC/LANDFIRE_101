# Accessing Data with LANDFIRE Data Streaming

The LANDFIRE Data Streams are a practical option for those who don’t want to (or need to) download datasets and just want to use data for display. This option can also be used to stream data into ArcGIS Pro or ArcGIS Online for analysis. There are several ways you can access data via data stream, all of which are found on the [Data page](https://landfire.gov/data) of the LANDFIRE Program website under the “Stream Data” heading.

We discuss each of these options in more depth below, and you can also find more information by clicking the links for each data stream type from the LANDFIRE Program website.

# Accessing Data with LANDFIRE Products Service

The LANDFIRE Products Service (LFPS) is a powerful tool that allows users to download various landscape data products. Here’s a quick overview to get you started:

-   **What is LFPS?**
    -   LFPS is a service that provides access to a wide range of landscape data products through a REST API. This allows you to request and download LANDFIRE products through an API using HTTPS requests.
    
-   **How to Make a Request**
    -   To get data, you’ll need to specify certain parameters in your request, such as the product layer you want and the area of interest. This helps the service understand exactly what data you need.

    -   The LFPS can be accessed in several ways:
        -   Python, php, unix wget, or anything that can call a URL (including an internet browser)

        -   Scripting tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)

        -   Through ESRI’s REST API/Web Interface using the [LANDFIRE Product Service URL](https://lfps.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/LandfireProductService/GPServer/LandfireProductService)
        
-   **Customizing Your Request**
    -   You can customize your data request with optional settings like output projection (how the data is mapped) and resample resolution (the detail level of the data).
    
-   **Understanding Responses**
    -   When you make a request, you’ll receive messages that tell you if your request was successful or if there were any errors. These messages help you troubleshoot and ensure you get the data you need.

For more detailed instructions and examples, please refer to the full [LANDFIRE Products Service User Guide](https://lfps.usgs.gov/helpdocs/LFProductsServiceUserGuide.pdf).

# ESRI Image Service

ESRI Image Service, also known as ArcGIS Image Server or simply Image Server, is a component of the ArcGIS platform. ESRI Image Services allow you to view and interact with raster datasets in ArcGIS Pro or ArcGIS Online. This service makes it easy to access LANDFIRE spatial datasets without needing to download them to your computer.

The benefit of using the ESRI image service over other data streaming such as WCS and WMS is that image services and hosted imagery layers allow you to perform analyses and view pop-ups, pixel information, and attributes rather than just viewing the data with no additional information or capabilities.

To use ESRI Image Service (ArcGIS Image Server) in combination with LANDFIRE spatial data, you'll need to follow these steps:

::: callout-tip
It’s important to follow the documents linked below very carefully, as the Image Service URLs are set up for ArcMap and previous versions of ArcGIS Online. There are additional steps you may need to take in order to make the image service rasters work as expected.
:::

-   **ArcGIS Desktop (ArcMap/ArcGIS Pro)**: Add the image service as a layer in your map document following the process outlined in the [How to use Image Service URLs in ArcPro document](https://landfire.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Instructions_ImageService_ArcPro.pdf) found on the [LANDFIRE Stream Data page](https://landfire.gov/data/lf_stream) of the LANDFIRE Program website.

-   **ArcGIS Online**: Open the Image Services URL for the project you’re interested in using (found on the [LANDFIRE Stream Data page](https://landfire.gov/data/lf_stream) of the LANDFIRE Program website).

    -   From here you can click on the ArcGIS Online Map Viewer link at the top of the page. This will open the image service layer page on ArcGIS Online where you can view metadata and attributes.

    -   To view the spatial data in a map, you must open the layer in a Map View.

    -   For more detailed instructions, please see the [How to Use Image Services in ArcGIS Online document](https://landfire.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Instructions_ImageService_AGOL.pdf), found on the LANDFIRE Stream Data page.

-   **Web mapping platforms** like Leaflet, OpenLayers, or Cesium: Use the REST endpoint of the image service along with appropriate WMS or tile layer options.

-   **Analyze and process LANDFIRE data**:
    -   With the LANDFIRE image service added to your map, you can perform various spatial analysis tasks, such as:
        -   Overlaying LANDFIRE data with other raster or vector datasets for combined analysis.

        -   Using tools like Zonal Statistics, Map Algebra, or Raster Calculator to derive new information from LANDFIRE data.

        -   Applying image processing techniques (e.g., band math, hillshade, or reclassification) to enhance the visual representation or extract specific features.

By following these steps, you can effectively use ESRI Image Service to publish and access LANDFIRE spatial data for further analysis and visualization within the ArcGIS platform.

# Web Map Service and Web Coverage Service

**The OpenGIS® Web Map Service Interface Standard (WMS)** is an HTTP interface for requesting and serving geospatial map images over the internet. A WMS request defines the geographic layer(s) and area of interest to be processed and serves, or responds, with one or more geospatial map images that are able to be displayed in a browser application. A WMS call allows you to access and view LF data within your desktop mapping session that are formatted as they appear on the LF Map Viewer.

**Web Coverage Service (WCS)** is also an HTTP interface that provides an open specification for sharing datasets on the web. WCS allows you to access LF products for analysis or modeling without downloading data. WCS provides the pixel value of the data.

-   **Hawaii only**: The provided WCS URLs will work with ESRI tools. QGIS and other non-ESRI products will be unable to use the WCS URL to view the Hawaii LF data as it is projected in ESRI 102007. Users **can** use non-ESRI products to view downloaded LF data from the map viewer or mosaic download.

You can find the WMS and WCS urls on the [LANDFIRE Stream Data page](https://landfire.gov/data/lf_stream) on the LANDFIRE Program website.

::: callout-note
You cannot change symbology or do analysis with the WMS or WCS. You can simply view the data and display it in your maps.
:::

For information on how to use these products within ArcMap and ArcGIS Pro, please see the instructions on how to use WCS and WMS calls in Arc on the LANDFIRE Program Website. You can find these at the bottom of the [LANDFIRE Stream Data page](https://landfire.gov/data/lf_stream).

-   [Instructions on how to use ArcGIS Online](https://landfire.gov/sites/default/files/documents/HowtouseArcGISOnlinewithLANDFIREdata.pdf)

# ArcGIS Online

You can also simply find the LANDFIRE data layers in the ArcGIS Online catalog and access them (as hosted imagery services) in ArcGIS Online or via the portal in ArcGIS Pro. To do this, you need to know the name of the dataset you’re looking for or know the direct URL or feature ID.

USGS has collected LANDFIRE datasets in their gallery on ArcGIS Online. You can access the gallery, filtered by Imagery Layers on the [USGS Organizational ArcGIS Online platform](https://usgs.maps.arcgis.com/home/gallery.html?sortField=relevance&sortOrder=desc&focus=layers-weblayers-imagery).
