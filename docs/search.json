Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands do not have BpS data developed. 950 Biophysical Settings are grouped into seven major vegetation classes and displayed using one color family for each class.\n\n\n\n\n\nLANDFIRE‚Äôs Biophysical Settings spatial product, also known as BpS, is a spatial representation of the BpS concept we discussed in the previous section. LANDFIRE uses BpS to depict reference conditions of vegetation across landscapes.\nAs of 2016, BpS now includes information on the historical fire regime, such as fire return intervals, percent of fire severities, and fire regime groups. Since LANDFIRE‚Äôs fire regime information is based on the historic context, we include it with BpS to provide a better picture of the pre-colonization landscape to the best of our knowledge.\nThe Biophysical Settings attributes correspond with the information in the Biophysical Settings Descriptions discussed in the BpS Descriptionsection of this website. We suggest that you review this information for a more complete understanding of the Biophysical Settings attributes.\nFor even more information, we‚Äôve created this short BpS 101 video on YouTube (3 minutes ).\n\n\n\n\nBPS_CODE: The unique code LANDFIRE uses for each Biophysical Setting\nZone: The NLCD map zone(s) the Bps is located in or relates to\nBPS_MODEL: The unique BpS Model code. This combines the BpS code with the zone(s) the model is located in. In some cases, a BpS with the same name and BpS Code may be split among map zones because the vegetation or disturbance regimes vary enough that the descriptions differ. An example of this is the ‚ÄòLaurentian-Acadian Northern Hardwoods forest‚Äô BpS (13020), which has four different BpS Models, although it is mapped as one BpS type.\nBPS_NAME: The name of the Biophysical Setting. The name is matched to the BpS Code, not the BpS model number.\nGROUPVEG: Coarse vegetation type groupings highlighting the high-level dominant vegetation within that BpS. Note that if a BpS is listed as ‚ÄòHardwood‚Äô it may actually be a mix of hardwood, herbaceous, savannah, and more, but LANDFIRE‚Äôs mapping identified hardwoods as dominating most of the landscape.\nFire Regime Attributes\n\nFRI_REPLAC: Average historic replacement-severity fire frequency for the BpS\nFRI_MIXED: Average historic mixed-severity fire frequency for the BpS\nFRI_SURFAC: Average historic surface-severity fire frequency for the BpS\nFRI_ALLFIR: Average historic fire frequency for all fires within the BpS.\nPRC_REPLAC: Percent of historic fires with replacement severity for the BpS\nPRC_MIXED: Percent of historic fires with mixed serverity for the BpS\nPRC_SURFAC: Percent of historic fires with surface severity for the BpS\nFRG_NEW: The fire regime group this BpS is found in. Fire regime groups are based on a combination of fire return interval and fire severity. The current Fire Regime Groups were updated in 2016, and have been modified from a previous classification. You can find the new breakdown of fire regime groups in the Attribute Data Dictionaryfor the BpS spatial data.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Biophysical Settings data is included in the Vegetation section of the LANDFIRE Program Website on the Biophysical Settings page.

    "text": "LANDFIRE‚Äôs Biophysical Settings data, also known as BpS, represents the vegetation system that may have been dominant on the landscape prior to European colonization and is based on both the current biophysical environment and an approximation of the historical disturbance regime. LANDFIRE uses BpS to depict reference conditions of vegetation across landscapes.\nAs of 2016, BpS now includes information on the historical fire regime, such as fire return intervals, percent of fire severities, and fire regime groups. Since LANDFIRE‚Äôs fire regime information is based on the historic context, we include it with BpS to provide a better picture of the pre-colonization landscape to the best of our knowledge.\nThe Biophysical Settings attributes correspond with the information in the Biophysical Settings Descriptions discussed in the BpS Description section of this website. We suggest that you review this information for a more complete understanding of the Biophysical Settings attributes.\nFor even more information, we‚Äôve created this short BpS 101 video on YouTube (3 minutes ).\n\n\n\nBPS_CODE: The unique code LANDFIRE uses for each Biophysical Setting\nZone: The NLCD map zone(s) the Bps is located in or relates to\nBPS_MODEL: The unique BpS Model code. This combines the BpS code with the zone(s) the model is located in. In some cases, a BpS with the same name and BpS Code may be split among map zones because the vegetation or disturbance regimes vary enough that the descriptions differ. An example of this is the ‚ÄòLaurentian-Acadian Northern Hardwoods forest‚Äô BpS (13020), which has four different BpS Models, although it is mapped as one BpS type. (See the screenshot below.)\nBPS_NAME: The name of the Biophysical Setting. The name is matched to the BpS Code, not the BpS model number.\nGROUPVEG: Coarse vegetation type groupings highlighting the high-level dominant vegetation within that BpS. Note that if a BpS is listed as ‚ÄòHardwood‚Äô it may actually be a mix of hardwood, herbaceous, savannah, and more, but LANDFIRE‚Äôs mapping identified hardwoods as dominating most of the landscape.\nFire Regime Attributes\n\nFRI_REPLAC: Average historic replacement-severity fire frequency for the BpS\nFRI_MIXED: Average historic mixed-severity fire frequency for the BpS\nFRI_SURFAC: Average historic surface-severity fire frequency for the BpS\nFRI_ALLFIR: Average historic fire frequency for all fires within the BpS\nPRC_REPLAC: Percent of historic fires with replacement severity for the BpS\nPRC_MIXED: Percent of historic fires with mixed serverity for the BpS\nPRC_SURFAC: Percent of historic fires with surface severity for the BpS\nFRG_NEW: The fire regime group this BpS is found in. Fire regime groups are based on a combination of fire return interval and fire severity. The current Fire Regime Groups were updated in 2016, and have been modified from a previous classification.

For example, ( A = 200,000 ) acres.\n\n-   **Quantify the return interval:** Let ( R ) be the return interval. For this example, ( R = 25 ), so the annual probability ( P ) is given by: P = 1/R = 1/25 = 0.04\n\n-   **Calculate the Area Affected by Surface Fire**: You multiply the acres on the landscape by the return interval.

It lays the foundation for accurate analyses, informed decision-making, and successful outcomes in various fields, from scientific research to business intelligence.\nHere are three main reasons to understand the attributes of LANDFIRE data before any analysis in GIS or R:\n\nData Familiarity: Exploring attributes provides a deep understanding of the dataset‚Äôs structure, format, and content. This familiarity is essential for making informed decisions about data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.\nUnderstanding Data Quality: Examining data attributes helps assess the quality and reliability of the dataset.

    "section": "",
    "text": "What you will learn here\nThe Reference Conditions Table (RCT) is essentially an output from the Biophysical Settings Models that focuses specifically on succession class and fire regime. In this section we will:\n\nExplore the fields in the RCT\nDiscuss RCT use cases\nExplain where to get the table\n\n\n\nThe Reference Conditions Table\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nüí° We suggest you review the content on Biophysical Settings, specifically the Biophysical Settings Spatial Data page where we discuss BpS attributes, before you work through this material. We discuss Succession Class in more detail in a later section of this website.\n\n\nThe RCT as downloaded is a .csv file with the following fields:\n\nBiophysical Settings identifiers:\n\nBpS_Code\nBpS_Name\nModel_Code\n\nSuccession Class Reference Percents, Classes A ‚Äì E, e.g., ‚ÄòClassA_ReferencePercent‚Äô\nFire Return Intervals, e.g., ‚ÄòFRI_ReplacementFire‚Äô\nPercent of fires, surface, mixed and replacement, e.g., ‚ÄòPercentOfFires_ReplacementFire‚Äô\nFire Regime Group: FRG_New\n\n\n\nSome common uses of the Reference Conditions Table\nThis table can be a quick way to get reference percentages and to understand overall historical fire dynamics of BpSs. We use the RCT to:\n\nGet reference succession class percentages when making charts such as the demo figure inserted below. This figure depicts reference vs.¬†current succession classes for the Southern Rockies ecoregion and could be helpful when thinking about the major Biophysical Settings on a landscape and how their succession classes may (or may not) have changed over time.\nUnderstand the relative proportion of surface, mixed, and replacement fire severity for a given Biophysical Setting.\nCompare fire frequency, severity, and fire regime between Biophysical Settings.\n\n\n\n\nReference vs.¬†current succession classes for the Southern Rockies ecoregion.\n\n\n\nQuickly calculate estimated historical annual acres burned.\nQuantify the amount of a BpS on the landscape: Let ( A ) represent the acres of the landscape. For example, ( A = 200,000 ) acres.\nQuantify the return interval: Let ( R ) be the return interval. For this example, ( R = 25 ), so the annual probability ( P ) is given by: P = 1/R = 1/25 = 0.04\nCalculate the Area Affected by Surface Fire: You multiply the acres on the landscape by the return interval. The area affected ( S ) can be calculated as:\nS=A√óP\nPutting it all together, the equation becomes:\nS=200,000√ó(0.04)=8,000 acres of surface fire\nThe following chart depicts annual acres burned, all fire types, for the most dominant BpSs of the Southern Rockies.\n\n\n\n\nAnnual acres burned for all fire types in the Southern Rockies biophysical settings.\n\n\nThe reference conditions table is important in landscape assessments and LANDFIRE‚Äôs vegetation departure, both of which we will discuss more in-depth in future sections of this learning website.\n\n\nWhere to find the Reference Conditions Table\nThe RCT is downloadable on the Bps Models page of the LANDFIRE Program website. Scroll down to the ‚ÄúDownload BpS Models and Descriptions‚Äù section, then click ‚ÄúReference Conditions‚Äù which will begin an immediate download. Unless you specify the download location, the file will likely end up in your default Downloads folder.\nTo access the file, open the .csv in Excel, R, or any other program you use to view .csv files.\n\n\n\nWhere to download the Reference Conditions Table",

Fire regime groups are based on a combination of fire return interval and fire severity. The current Fire Regime Groups were updated in 2016, and have been modified from a previous classification. You can find the new breakdown of fire regime groups in the Attribute Data Dictionaryfor the BpS spatial data.",
