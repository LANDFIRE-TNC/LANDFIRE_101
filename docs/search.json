In this section we will:\n\nExplore the fields in the Reference Conditions Table\nUnderstand how the Reference Conditions Table is linked to the BpS through succession class\nDiscuss Reference Conditions Table use cases\nExplain where to get the Reference Conditions Table\n\n\n\nThe Reference Conditions Table\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n💡 We suggest you review the content on Biophysical Settings, specifically the Biophysical Settings Spatial Data page where we discuss BpS attributes, before you work through this material. We discuss Succession Class in more detail in a later section of this website. Remember that reference conditions relate to the pre-European colonization period and not today or the future.\n\n\nThe Reference Conditions Table summarizes the vegetation and fire regime reference conditions for every BpS. Vegetation reference conditions estimate the relative proportion of each succession class. Fire regime reference conditions estimate the frequency and severity of fire within a BpS. LANDFIRE calculates reference conditions using the BpS model. These results are also in the BpS description.\nWhen you download the Reference Condition Table you will get a zipped .csv file with the following fields:\n\nBiophysical Settings identifiers:\n\nBpS_Code\nBpS_Name\nModel_Code\n\nSuccession Class Reference Percents, Classes A – E, e.g., ‘ClassA_ReferencePercent’\nFire Return Intervals, surface, mixed, and replacement, e.g., ‘FRI_ReplacementFire’\nPercent of fires, surface, mixed, and replacement, e.g., ‘PercentOfFires_ReplacementFire’\nFire Regime Group: FRG_New.

The class letters are defined in the Succession Classes Description section of the document.\n\n\n\n\nSome common uses of the Reference Conditions Table\nThis table can be a quick way to get reference percentages and to understand overall historical fire dynamics of BpS. LANDFIRE Uses the RCT to compare reference succession class amounts to current amounts to calculate vegetation departure.\nOther common uses of the RCT include:\nGetting reference succession class percentages when making charts such as the demo figure below. This figure depicts reference vs. current succession classes for the Southern Rockies ecoregion and could be helpful when thinking about the major Biophysical Settings on a landscape and how their succession classes may (or may not) have changed over time.\n\n\n\nReference vs. current succession classes for the Southern Rockies ecoregion.\n\n\nUnderstanding the relative proportion of surface, mixed, and replacement fire severity for a given BpS.\nComparing fire frequency, severity, and fire regime between BpS.\nQuickly calculating estimated historical annual surface acres burned:\n\nQuantify the amount of a BpS on the landscape: Let ( A ) represent the acres of the landscape. For example, ( A = 200,000 ) acres.\nQuantify the return interval: Let ( R ) be the return interval for surface fires. For this example, ( R = 25 ), so the annual probability ( P ) is given by: P = 1/R = 1/25 = 0.04\nCalculate the Area Affected by Surface Fire: You multiply the acres on the landscape by the return interval. The area affected ( S ) can be calculated as: S=A×P\nPutting it all together, the equation becomes:\nS=200,000×(0.04)=8,000 acres of surface fire\n\nThe following chart depicts annual acres burned, all fire types, for the most dominant BpSs of the Southern Rockies, calculated using the formula above but including all fire types. Explore the context for this chart.\n\n\n\nAnnual acres burned for all fire types in the Southern Rockies biophysical settings.\n\n\nThe reference conditions table is important in landscape assessments and LANDFIRE’s vegetation departure, both of which we will discuss more in-depth in future sections of this learning website.\n\n\nWhere to find the Reference Conditions Table\nThe RCT is downloadable on the Bps Models page of the LANDFIRE Program website.

Users that need a complete and detailed ruleset should use the mapping rules spreadsheet. You can find that spreadsheet on the Biophysical Settings Description and Quantitative Models page of the LANDFIRE Program website.\n\n\n\nSuccession Classes – description\nThis section provides a description of the development states of a BpS as conceptualized by the model developers within the LANDFIRE modeling framework. Developers were allowed to describe and model up to five states. Each class is identified by a letter (A-E) and a name that describes its cover and structure (e.g. Early Development 1 All Structures).\nThe combination of the BpS code and the class letter links the succession class description to the reference condition table. The BpS code and class name link the succession class to the BpS model. For more detail on this, see our linking the BpS models and descriptions pdf.\nThe number to the right of the class letter represents the modeled reference condition for that class. In other words, the percent of the landscape that you would expect to be in the class on average, over long time periods, for the extent of a BpS within a mapzone.\n\n\nModel Parameters Table\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA word about SyncroSim SyncroSim is a modeling platform used to build and run state-and-transition simulation models (STSMs), which represent how ecosystems change over time due to natural disturbances and succession. In LANDFIRE, SyncroSim is used to manage and update the Biophysical Settings models, replacing the earlier VDDT software. It allows model developers to define probabilities and impacts of disturbances like fire, and to simulate how ecosystems would have looked under historical conditions. The reference conditions table is essentially an export of these model parameters from SyncroSim.\n\n\n\nThe model parameters table is essentially an export of the SyncroSim BpS model parameters. In other words, this table compiles information provided by model developers about the probability and impact of natural disturbances into the modeling software.\nIn the Model Parameters Table below, the top row would read something like “the wind/weather/stress disturbance would impact the Early1:All succession class once every 1000 years on average (or 0.001% of the succession class yearly on average), and when that disturbance happened, the vegetation would respond by returning back to the beginning of the Early1: All succession class.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisturbance Type\nDisturbance occurs in\nMoves vegetation to\nDisturbance Probability\nReturn Interval (yrs)\nReset Age to New Class Start Age after Disturbance?\nYears Since Last Disturbance\n\n\n\n\nWind or Weather Stress\nEarly1:ALL\nEarly1:ALL\n0.001\n1000\nYes\n0\n\n\nReplacement Fire\nEarly1:ALL\nEarly1:ALL\n0.001\n1000\nYes\n0\n\n\nAlternative Succession\nMid1:OPN\nLate1:CLS\n1\n1\nYes\n100\n\n\nMixed Fire\nMid1:OPN\nMid1:OPN\n0.001\n1000\nNo\n0\n\n\n\n\nReset age class start after disturbance\nIn SyncroSim, the ‘Age Reset’ field indicates whether a transition resets the age of a simulation cell to the ‘Age Min’ of the destination class. If the value is yes, the age is reset; if no, the age remains unchanged. According to LANDFIRE standards, probabilistic transitions that do not change the class do not reset the age (Age Reset = No), except for class A to A replacement disturbances. Transitions that result in a state change do reset the age (Age Reset = Yes).\nYears since last disturbance\nYears since last disturbance, referred to as TST Min (time-since-transition minimum) in SyncroSim, specifies the minimum number of years that must pass before a transition can occur. In LANDFIRE models, this is used only with Alternative Succession transitions and is related to fire disturbances (surface, mixed, and replacement). For example, if an Alternative Succession transition has a TST Min value of 100, it means that this transition can only happen if 100 years have passed since the last fire.\n\n\nHelpful Resources\n\nDeciphering the BpS model code (opens a pdf on Box)\nLinking the Bps models and descriptions (opens a pdf on Box)\nSuccession class mapping rules spreadsheet (downloads a zip file)\nBlankenship, K., Swaty, R., Hall, K.R., Hagen, S., Pohl, K., Shlisky Hunt, A., Patton, J., Frid, L. and Smith, J., 2021.

You can learn more about each of these products on the following pages of this website—just click on the product name (in bold) below to jump to its dedicated section.\nBPS Spatial Data This 30m pixel raster dataset represents the potential natural vegetation types that likely existed prior to significant Euro-American influence. It serves as a spatial foundation for modeling ecological processes and is used in a wide range of applications, from fire behavior modeling to habitat assessment.\nBPS Descriptions These narrative documents provide detailed ecological context for each BPS, including dominant vegetation, disturbance regimes, and successional dynamics. They support interpretation of the spatial data and models and are developed with input from regional experts.\nBPS Models These are quantitative state-and-transition models that simulate how vegetation changes over time in response to natural disturbances and succession. Built using the SyncroSim platform, they form the basis for estimating reference conditions and understanding long-term ecological dynamics.\nReference Conditions Table This table summarizes the expected proportions of different vegetation classes under historical, pre-settlement conditions for each BpS.

This platform is designed to familiarize you with the LANDFIRE Program, its comprehensive website, and some of the invaluable datasets it provides.\nLANDFIRE users include district rangers, managers and natural resource specialists who may be tasked with a variety of objectives ranging from managing fuels, wildfires, multiple use requirements, wildlife habitat, and climate change. LANDFIRE products, while not all encompassing, provide a solid foundation. LANDFIRE aims for consistency and updates most datasets annually. The datasets serve as inputs for programs such as the Wildland Fire Decision Support System (WFDSS), the Interagency Fuels Treatment Decision Support System (IFTDSS), and Wildfire Risk to Communities. Getting started with LANDFIRE may feel daunting, but this website aims to support anyone getting started with (or diving deeper into) the broad LANDFIRE suite.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis LANDFIRE 101 learning website serves as a supporting addendum to the comprehensive LANDFIRE Program website. The LANDFIRE 101 learning website can be followed from start-to-finish and provides practical support for LANDFIRE users. This supporting site should be used in conjunction with (not instead of) the LANDFIRE Program website. As such, this website provides essential information for using and applying LANDFIRE products. Each page provides multiple opportunities for understanding and exploring these data further on the LANDFIRE Program website.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is LANDFIRE?\nLANDFIRE, Landscape Fire and Resource Management Planning Tools, is a shared program between the wildland fire management programs of the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service Fire and Aviation branch and the U.S. Department of the Interior. It provides more than twenty landscape-scale geospatial products, 950 vegetation models, and tools supporting all-lands planning, management, and operations.\nLANDFIRE’s mission is to provide agency leaders and managers with a common ‘all-lands’ dataset of vegetation, wildland fire, and fuels information for strategic fire and resource management planning and analysis. Learn more about LANDFIRE’s mission on the LANDFIRE Program website.\n\n\nWhat is The Nature Conservancy’s connection?\nThe Nature Conservancy (TNC) is a major partner in the LANDFIRE Program supported by a cooperative agreement through the USDA Forest Service. TNC’s LANDFIRE Team works closely with the LANDFIRE Business Leads, program staff, and other partners to provide support to LANDFIRE users.\nLANDFIRE user support can take many forms. Providing this assistance can range from in-person and online workshops to monthly office hours, newsletters and data alerts to technical, personalized assistance. Links to where you can find all these information sources and more are at the bottom of each page. TNC’s LANDFIRE team is dedicated to developing current, user-focused LANDFIRE resources that advance natural resource work, amplify the appropriate use of LANDFIRE products, and leverage the collective knowledge of the natural resource community.\nLANDFIRE’s website offers a wealth of resources related to wildland fire and natural resource management. Users can access all LANDFIRE data, resources, applications, and updated information on the LANDFIRE Program website.\n\n\nWhat you will learn\nOur LANDFIRE 101 learning website provides a foundation for:\n\nBasic background information about LANDFIRE vegetation and fuels datasets\nImportant attributes of each dataset\nHow and where to download each product\nExamples of how these products are commonly used\nHow to avoid common misapplications of the data\n\nWhether you are a novice or seeking to deepen your expertise, this training platform provides the insights and practical skills necessary for leveraging LANDFIRE data in your projects. We invite you to join us and discover how these powerful tools can support your endeavors in land management and beyond.\n\n\n\n\n\nStill have questions?

For example, key datasets such as Biophysical Settings, Existing Vegetation, and Succession Class are integrated to create the Vegetation Departure product. Here, you’ll learn how to access and make good use of these datasets. We’ll walk you through how to download each one and share real-life examples of how they can be applied. We’ll also introduce you to other helpful tools that can improve your work.\n\nA word about vegetation classifications\nLANDFIRE adopted NatureServe’s Ecological Systems (ES) classification in 2004. At that time, it was the only consistent mid-scale, continent-wide classification available and its ecological foundation fit the needs of the project as designed. ES is currently used in the Existing Vegetation Type (EVT), Environmental Site Potential, and Biophysical Settings (BpS) spatial layers, as well as the Biophysical Settings Models and Descriptions products.\nIn addition to Ecological Systems, the EVT layer incorporates additional classes to represent developed and agricultural land use classes. Three other classifications are provided as attributes of the EVT layer: National Vegetation Classification Group (NVCG), National Vegetation Classification Macrogroup (NVCM) and Society of American Foresters/Society of Range Management (SAF/SRM) Cover Type. The only classification that is directly mapped by LANDFIRE at the present time is ES. NVCG is provided as a separate spatial layer in LF2016. It was modeled separately from the ES in some parts of CONUS, and in some areas it was crosswalked from LF2016 ES. The SAF/SRM attribute was created using a crosswalk with ES. Since the National Vegetation Classification is hierarchical, NVCM is created by rolling-up NVCG into the next highest level of the classification.\n\n\nWhat you will find in this section\n\nA brief overview of some commonly used datasets\nHow to download and access LANDFIRE datasets\nHow these key LANDFIRE datasets are linked to one another\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStill have questions?

    "text": "Key BPS Attributes include\n\nBPS_CODE: The unique code LANDFIRE uses for each Biophysical Setting.\nZone: The NLCD map zone(s) the BPS is located in or relates to.\nBPS_MODEL: The unique BPS Model code. This combines the BPS code with the zone(s) the model is located in. In some cases, a BPS with the same name and BPS Code may be split among map zones because the vegetation or disturbance regimes vary enough that the descriptions differ. An example of this is the ‘Laurentian-Acadian Northern Hardwoods forest’ BPS (13020), which has four different BPS Models:\n\n13020_40 (BPS 13020, Map Zone 40)\n13020_63 (BPS 13020, Map Zone 63)\n13020_65_66 (BPS 13020, Map Zone 65 and 66)\n13020_65_66 (BPS 13020, Map Zone 65 and 66)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote, there will be a separate row and VALUE for each BPS_CODE/MapZone combination, such as presented in the above example where there are two rows for 13020_65_66.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe attribute for map zone in the BPS attribute table creates duplicate rows in the table in cases where one model applies to multiple map zones. For users only interested in unique BPS, we recommend performing a spatial lookup based on the BPS_Model code. This will allow the user to visualize each unique BPS in an area of interest.\n\n\n\nBPS_NAME: The name of the Biophysical Setting.\nGROUPVEG: Coarse vegetation type groupings highlighting the high-level dominant vegetation within that BPS. Note that if a BPS is listed as ‘Hardwood’ it may actually be a mix of hardwood, herbaceous, savannah, and more, but hardwoods are defined as the dominant vegetation type\nPre-European Colonization Fire Regime Attributes:\n\nFRI_REPLAC: Average historic replacement-severity fire frequency for the BPS.\nFRI_MIXED: Average historic mixed-severity fire frequency for the BPS.\nFRI_SURFAC: Average historic surface-severity fire frequency for the BPS.\nFRI_ALLFIR: Average historic fire frequency for all fires within the BPS.\nPRC_REPLAC: Percent of historic fires with replacement severity for the BPS.\nPRC_MIXED: Percent of historic fires with mixed severity for the BPS.\nPRC_SURFAC: Percent of historic fires with surface severity for the BPS.\nFRG_NEW: The fire regime group for the BPS. Fire regime groups are based on a combination of fire return interval and fire severity. The current Fire Regime Groups were updated in 2016 and have been modified from a previous classification. You can find the new breakdown of fire regime groups in the Attribute Data Dictionary (opens a pdf) for the BPS spatial data.\n\n\nThe LANDFIRE spatial data layers allow for display and analysis on multiple attributes and at varying levels of specificity. Three examples of how you can display, aggregate, and evaluate Biophysical Settings information are presented in the following images.\n\n\n\nBiophysical Settings data for the contiguous United States (CONUS) are displayed on the BPS_Name attribute. In this map Biophysical Settings are grouped into seven major vegetation classes and displayed using one color family for each class. This map was designed using a custom color ramp created by Sarah Hagen.\n\n\n\n\n\nBiophysical Settings data for the contiguous United States (CONUS) are displayed on the GROUPVEG attribute. In this map Biophysical Settings are displayed using one color for each major vegetation group (conifer, mixed hardwood-conifer, hardwood, grassland, savannah, riparian, shrubland, sparse vegetation). This map was designed using a custom color ramp created by Sarah Hagen.\n\n\n\n\n\nBiophysical Settings data for the contiguous United States (CONUS) are displayed on the FRG_NEW attribute. This map explores the fire regime attributes of the Biophysical Settings data, with more frequent fire areas in reds and oranges, moderate frequency fire areas in yellow and pale green, and lower frequency fire areas in shades of blue. This map was designed using a custom color ramp created by Sarah Hagen.",

Seriously, after installing packages and libraries some of the functions just work better if you do so.\nIf it is not there, open the LANDFIRE BpS Reference Condition Models library by going to File -&gt; Open then navigating to the Reference-Condition-Models.ssim file, likely in your SyncroSim directory. You will then click Open.\nOnce opened, the LANDFIRE BpS Reference Condition Models will be in the Library Explorer pane. You will also see, within the library, a project named Definitions and a Scenario named Reference Condition Models.\nClick the Reference Condition Models scenario once to highlight it.\nGo to Edit -&gt; Export LFVM Strata to bring up the selection window.\nOnce at the Export LFVM Strata window, you will check the BpS of interest, give a file name for the new library and assign a folder that it will be saved to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe do not suggest selecting many strata at once until you are familiar with the modeling process. Stick to 1-3 initially.\n\n\n\nScreenshots of isolating a model\n\n\n\nSelect scenario\n\n\n\n\n\nExport strata\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new library with selected strata",

    "text": "Explore the models you are interested in\n💡 Screenshots of the process are included below the written instructions for those who find them useful.\nBy exploring the BpS models you can learn how the modeling experts parameterized them, and more interactively see how the disturbances and states all fit together.\nStart exploring:\n\nDouble click on Reference Condition Models then the Transition Pathways tab.\nTo make viewing easier go to Window -&gt; Arrange All.\nAt the bottom will be tabs of all of the BpSs that are in this library. Click any one. See Transitions Pane.\nClick on any box to see the pathways associated with that state (i.e., succession class).\nIf you want to run the scenario:\n\nGo to the Output Options tab within the scenario, make sure that the ‘State classes every’ box is set to 100 (i.e., not 1).\nGo to the Run Control tab and set the Total iterations to 2.\nIn the Initial Conditions tab, ensure that the Total Acres and Number of Simulation Cells boxes both have 1,000. For exploring, we recommend these three steps as it will speed up your runs.\nIn the Library Explorer, highlight the scenario, then click the small green triangle at the top of the screen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe model results will not change significantly unless you change the model parameters.\n\n\n\nMake a chart by clicking the New icon in the Charts pane, then name it appropriately. You will change some settings to get your first chart:\n\nChange Line Chart to Column Chart (top left of window)\nUnder State Classes select Proportion\nUnder Disaggregate by check the State Class box\nUnder Include Data For, click State Class then select the appropriate state classes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you have multiple BpS, you will also want to go to and select one Model under the Include Data For dropdown\n\n\n-   Click Apply\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nST-Sim is stochastic, so every time a model is run the results will be slightly different. If you run a BpS model in ST-Sim, you can expect the modeled succession class percents to be within +/-5% of the values reported in the BpS description and the reference condition table.\n\n\n\nScreenshots of running a model and making a chart\n\n\n\nState class outputs\n\n\n\n\n\nRun your model\n\n\n\n\n\nSet up your column chart",

    "text": "Key EVT attributes include:\n\nEVT_Name: Ecological Systems names\nEVT_Fuel: The Ecological Systems code used for LANDFIRE fuels product development\nEVT_Fuel_N: The Ecological Systems class name used for fuel product development\nEVT_LF: Major vegetation lifeform (e.g., tree, shrub, herb, sparse) for the ecological system. Note that if an EVT Lifeform is listed as ‘tree’ it may actually be a mix of tree, herb, savanna, and more, but the ecological system and LANDFIRE identified trees as dominating most of the landscape. LANDFIRE identifies a pixel as belonging to a certain Lifeform if greater than 10% of that pixel is in that Lifeform. LANDFIRE assigns Lifeforms in priority of the highest lifeform – tree, then shrub, then herbaceous.\nEVT_GP_N: The vegetation type name (e.g. grassland and steppe, longleaf pine, yellow birch-sugar maple forest). This is more specific than the lifeform, but less specific than the ecological system (EVT Name).\nEVT_PHYS: Vegetation physiognomy of the ecological system (e.g. Grassland, Riparian, Herbaceous, Sparsely Vegetated)\nSAF_SRM: Society of American Foresters/Society for Range Management cover types. This cross walk is intended to help users familiar with the SAF and SRM classifications orient to the EVT types acknowledging that the classifications may not be equivalent.\nEVT_ORDER: FGDC Vegetation physiognomic order (highest level/most general classification, e.g. Tree Dominated)\nEVT_CLASS: FGDC Vegetation class (mid level/more specific, e.g. Closed tree canopy)\nEVT_SBCLS: FGDC Vegetation subclass (lowest level/most specific, e.g. Deciduous closed tree canopy)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nLANDFIRE EVT can be used at a variety of scales but should only be used after conducting a local review to confirm data accuracy.\nCaution should be taken when comparing LANDFIRE versions as attribute tables are often changed to reflect the changing needs of users.\n\n\nThe LANDFIRE spatial data layers allow for display and analysis at varying levels of specificity. Given that the LANDFIRE EVT layer has over 1000 individual classes, users may need to craft a legend that meets their specific needs rather than using the default display. Two examples of how you can easily display EVT data using existing attributes are presented in the following images. These maps are presented as examples, but you can display or analyze EVT data on any of the attributes mentioned above.\n\n\n\nExisting Vegetation Type data for the contiguous United States (CONUS) are displayed on the EVT_Phys attribute. In this map Existing Vegetation Type data are grouped into thirteen major classes and displayed using one color for each class. This map was designed using a custom color ramp created by Sarah Hagen.\n\n\n\n\n\nExisting Vegetation Type data for the contiguous United States (CONUS) are displayed on the EVT_LF attribute.
