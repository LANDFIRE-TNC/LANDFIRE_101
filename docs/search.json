    "text": "What does BpS Mean?\nBiophysical Settings are a foundational concept for LANDFIRE defined on the LANDFIRE Program website as:\na modeled representation of the vegetation system that may have been dominant on the landscape prior to Euro-American settlement and is based on both the current biophysical environment and an approximation of modeled past disturbance regimes.\nWe like to think of the BpSs as “ecosystem habitats”, or “potential ecosystem footprints”. Essentially the BpS concept asks “where might an ecosystem occur” based on abiotic factors such as soils, surficial geology, slope and elevation. There are other ecological concepts that are worth contrasting the BpS concept to including:\n\nPotential Natural Vegetation: this concept might be best described by Hengl et al., (2018), “Potential natural vegetation (PNV) is the vegetation cover in equilibrium with climate, that would exist at a given location if not impacted by human activities”. The BpS concept differs from PNV in a couple key ways:\nBpS disturbances included indigenous management, which was extensive in some areas prior to European colonization\nPNVs are typically ‘static’, meaning they represent one “state” which is often the ‘climax’ state. BpSs almost always include multiple “states” representing a dynamic system.\nPre-settlement vegetation: these datasets rely on historical accounts, early land surveys and other methods such as sediment analysis to map ecosystems at a certain point in time. For example, land survey driven ecosystem maps often represent conditions as of ~ 1830s. The BpSs differ in that they 1) do not represent a specific point in time, rather the pre-European condition generally and 2) as with PNVs, they are systems with multiple classes.\n\nAs you will learn in the following sections, LANDFIRE maps, describes, and models each BpS.\n\n\nHow does BpS flow through the product suite?\n\n\n\nBpS is a key dataset that flows through the product suite, generating and contributing to other LANDFIRE datasets.",

    "text": "What does BpS Mean?\nBiophysical Settings are a foundational concept for LANDFIRE defined on the LANDFIRE Program website as:\na modeled representation of the vegetation system that may have been dominant on the landscape prior to Euro-American settlement and is based on both the current biophysical environment and an approximation of modeled past disturbance regimes.\nWe like to think of the BpSs as “ecosystem habitats”, or “potential ecosystem footprints”. Essentially the BpS concept asks “where might an ecosystem occur” based on abiotic factors such as soils, surficial geology, slope and elevation. There are other ecological concepts that are worth contrasting the BpS concept to including:\n\nPotential Natural Vegetation: this concept might be best described by Hengl et al., (2018), “Potential natural vegetation (PNV) is the vegetation cover in equilibrium with climate, that would exist at a given location if not impacted by human activities”. The BpS concept differs from PNV in a couple key ways:\nBpS disturbances included indigenous management, which was extensive in some areas prior to European colonization\nPNVs are typically ‘static’, meaning they represent one “state” which is often the ‘climax’ state. BpSs almost always include multiple “states” representing a dynamic system.\nPre-settlement vegetation: these datasets rely on historical accounts, early land surveys and other methods such as sediment analysis to map ecosystems at a certain point in time. For example, land survey driven ecosystem maps often represent conditions as of ~ 1830s. The BpSs differ in that they 1) do not represent a specific point in time, rather the pre-European condition generally and 2) as with PNVs, they are systems with multiple classes.\n\nAs you will learn in the following sections, LANDFIRE maps, describes, and models each BpS.\n\n\nHow does BpS flow through the product suite?\n\n\n\nBpS is a key dataset that flows through the product suite, generating and contributing to other LANDFIRE datasets.",
