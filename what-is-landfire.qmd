# What is LANDFIRE?

[LANDFIRE, *Landscape Fire and Resource Management Planning Tools*](https://www.landfire.gov/), is a shared program between the wildland fire management programs of the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service Fire and Aviation branch, and the U.S. Department of the Interior, that provides more than twenty landscape-scale geo-spatial products, 950 vegetation models, and a suite of tools that support all-lands planning, management, and operations. Learn more about the dynamic [LANDFIRE Program](https://landfire.gov/index.php).

## LANDFIRE's Mission

LANDFIRE's mission is to provide agency leaders and managers with a common "all-lands" data set of vegetation and wildland fire/fuels information for strategic fire and resource management planning and analysis.

## What does LANDFIRE provide?

The LANDFIRE Program delivers current, consistent, comprehensive data for the entire United States, including Alaska, Hawai'i, and Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.

This multi-partner program produces current, consistent, comprehensive, geospatial data and databases that describe vegetation, wildland fuel, and fire regimes across the United States and insular areas. Use the [LANDFIRE Technical Documentation](https://pubs.usgs.gov/publication/ofr20231045) to learn how LF creates the data. Use the [LANDFIRE Data Dictionary](https://www.landfire.gov/sites/default/files/documents/LF_Data_Dictionary.pdf) to help understand and locate LANDFIRE information.

**LF products are available by the following groupings:**

-   [Reference](https://landfire.gov/reference) - contribute data or access databases containing contributed disturbance events
-   [Disturbance](https://landfire.gov/disturbance) - a suite of products that categorizes annual and historical disturbance events
-   [Vegetation](https://landfire.gov/vegetation) - products that demonstrate vegetation change across the landscape and models of potential pre-European settlement vegetation systems
-   [Fuel](https://landfire.gov/fuel) - products that demonstrate the composition and characteristics of surface and canopy fuels along with fuel vegetation
-   [Historical Fire Regime](https://landfire.gov/fire-regime) - products that represent pre-European settlement fire frequency and severity
-   [Topographic](https://landfire.gov/topographic) - products that provide geospatial information describing the landscape

The table below shows a comprehensive list of all the datasets LANDFIRE provides in each category, with links to where you can learn more about each dataset, explore attribute tables, and download data.

# How Data Products and Information may be used

LANDFIRE products provide data for landscape assessment, analysis, and management. This information supports efforts such as identification of areas with similar characteristics, prioritization exercises, modeling capacity and potential, and improving collaboration between landowners with common data sets and analytics. Key applications that use LANDFIRE products are the [Wildland Fire Decision Support System (WFDSS)](https://wfdss.usgs.gov/), [Interagency Fuels Treatment Decision Support System](https://iftdss.firenet.gov/landing_page/), [Terrestrial Condition Assessment](https://terrestrial-condition-assessment-usfs.hub.arcgis.com/), and [Watershed Condition Class](https://www.fs.usda.gov/naturalresources/watershed/condition_framework.shtml).

# Timeline

[![A timeline of LANDFIRE Program milestones from 2002 to 2023. Source: landfire.gov](images/LF_timeline.png){fig-alt="LANDFIRE milestones from 2002 - 2023. In 2002 the LANDFIRE Project began. In 2004 rapid assessment began. In 2009 LANDFIRE released the first LANDFIRE version (LF National) and the LANDFIRE program was initiated. Between 2009 and 2022, five updates were completed as time allowed. In 2022, LANDFIRE began the annual update process with new versions released in 2022 and 2023."}](https://landfire.gov/about-landfire)

In 2004, the LANDFIRE Program was launched in response to growing concerns about the increasing number, severity, and size of wildland fires, as well as the need for consistent national biological and ecological inventory data.

LANDFIRE produces national-scale spatial products that provide the best available data on vegetation, fuels, fire regimes, and disturbances. These products are widely used by land managers to set priorities, develop management strategies, and create action plans, extending beyond fire management to include climate change research, carbon sequestration planning, and habitat analysis.

LANDFIRE’s collaborative nature, involving multiple agencies and organizations, has been key to its success. The program has improved relationships among scientists, managers, and the public, increased scientific capacity, and reduced barriers to implementation through a solid scientific foundation. Updates like the 2014 and 2016 Remap have incorporated landscape changes and disturbances, offering significant improvements and new products. LF’s Modeling Dynamic Fuels with an Index System (MoD-FIS) captures seasonal variability in fuels, enhancing fire behavior modeling, while the updated Biophysical Settings product suite provides detailed information about vegetation dynamics and fire regimes, supporting comprehensive land management and ecological decision-making.

# LANDFIRE Versions

Beginning in 2022, LANDFIRE is providing annual updates in which the landscape changes from the previous year are represented in the current year products. You can find the data delivery schedule on the [data page of the LANDFIRE Program website](https://landfire.gov/data#schedule).

LANDFIRE’s version history can be found in the [Version Description table](https://landfire.gov/data/comparison-table) on the LANDFIRE Program website. A [table comparing all LANDFIRE versions](https://landfire.gov/data/comparison-table) from LANDFIRE National (LFc2001) through the current version is also available on the same page.

::: callout-note
Please visit the [LANDFIRE Program website](https://landfire.gov/data) for the most recent data version and the most up-to-date release schedule.
:::

LANDFIRE data is currently available for the following extents, although not all areas have available data for each version:

-   Conterminous United States (CONUS)

-   Alaska (AK)

-   Hawaii (HI)

-   Insular Areas: American Samoa, Guam, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), Federated States of Micoronesia, Republic of Palau, Republic of Marshall Islands, Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands.

## What is The Nature Conservancy’s connection?

The Nature Conservancy (TNC) is a [Major Partner](https://www.landfire.gov/about-landfire/lfpartners) in the LANDFIRE Program supported by a cooperative agreement. TNC’s LANDFIRE Team works closely with the LANDFIRE Business Leads, program staff, and other partners to provide user support through:

-   helping users understand the strengths, weaknesses, and appropriate uses of LANDFIRE products

-   locating, obtaining, and using geospatial data, tools, and models for fire and natural resource management, planning, and implementation

-   identifying and comparing management priorities, evaluating threats to ecosystems, and exploring outcomes under alternative management scenarios
