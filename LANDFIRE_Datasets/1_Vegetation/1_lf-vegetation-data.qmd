In our work, we frequently utilize various vegetation and fire regime datasets to gain a deeper understanding of certain landscapes. For example, key datasets such as Biophysical Settings, Existing Vegetation, and Succession Class are integrated to create the Vegetation Departure product. Here, you’ll learn how to access and make good use of these datasets. We’ll walk you through how to download each one and share real-life examples of how they can be applied. We’ll also introduce you to other helpful tools that can improve your work.

# A word about vegetation classifications

LANDFIRE adopted NatureServe’s [Ecological Systems](https://www.natureserve.org/publications/ecological-systems-united-states) (ES) classification in 2004. At that time, it was the only consistent mid-scale, continent-wide classification available and its ecological foundation fit the needs of the project as designed. Ecological Systems is currently used in the Existing Vegetation Type (EVT) and Biophysical Settings (BpS) spatial layers, the Biophysical Settings Models and Descriptions products, and Historic Fire Regime. Three other classifications are provided as attributes of the EVT layer: National Vegetation Classification Group (NVCG), National Vegetation Classification Macrogroup (NVCM) and Society of American Foresters/Society of Range Management (SAF/SRM) Cover Type. The only classification that is directly mapped by LANDFIRE at the present time is ES. NVCG is provided as a separate spatial layer in LF2016 but its attributes and SAF/SRM’s attributes, are created using a crosswalk with ES. Since the National Vegetation Classification is hierarchical, NVCM is created by rolling-up NVCG into the next highest level of the classification.
