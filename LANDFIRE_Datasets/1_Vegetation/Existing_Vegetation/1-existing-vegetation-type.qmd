# Existing Vegetation Type

![LANDFIRE maps existing vegetation type for all of the United States, including Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands. This map groups more than 1000 vegetation types by major lifeform then displays them by color within each group.](images/EVT_map.bmp){fig-alt="A map of LANDFIRE Existing Vegetation Type for the Contiguous US, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands."}

LANDFIRE's (LF) Existing Vegetation Type (EVT-ES) represents the current distribution of the terrestrial ecological systems classification, developed by NatureServe for the western hemisphere, through 2016. A terrestrial ecological system is defined as a group of plant community types (associations) that tend to co-occur within landscapes with similar ecological processes, substrates, and/or environmental gradients. EVT is mapped using a combination of satellite imagery, biophysical gradient layers, and field plots. For more on this, see the LANDFIRE technical documentation.

EVT also includes ruderal or semi-natural vegetation types within the [U.S. National Vegetation Classification](https://usnvc.org/). The [LANDFIRE Ruderal NVC Groups Descriptions for CONUS](https://landfire.gov/sites/default/files/documents/LANDFIRE_Ruderal_NVC_Groups_Descriptions_CONUS.pdf) provides info for each ruderal NVC Group, including species, distribution, and classification details. At this time, EVT (and other LANDFIRE vegetation layers) extend 90km past the United States border into Mexico and Canada, allowing some crosswalk of EVT and other vegetation systems.

::: callout-important
Prior to LANDFIRE 2016, EVT were created based on the NatureServe terrestrial ecosystems classification. You can still find information on these data under [Existing Vegetation Type - Ecological Systems](https://landfire.gov/vegetation/evt). You can learn more about each of these ecological systems classifications on the separate product pages on the [LANDFIRE Program Website](https://landfire.gov/vegetation). Due to the differences in classification, users should not compare EVT versions created from 2016 onward with those created before 2016.
:::

## Key EVT Attributes include:

-   **EVT_Name**: Ecological Systems names

-   **EVT_Fuel**: The Ecological Systems code used for LANDFIRE fuels product development

-   **EVT_Fuel_N**: The Ecological Systems class name used for fuel product development

-   **EVT_LF**: Major vegetation lifeform (e.g., tree, shrub, herb, sparse) for the ecological system. Note that if an EVT Lifeform is listed as ‘tree’ it may actually be a mix of tree, herb, savanna, and more, but the ecological system and LANDFIRE identified trees as dominating most of the landscape. LANDFIRE identifies a pixel as belonging to a certain Lifeform if greater than 10% of that pixel is in that Lifeform.

-   **EVT_GP_N**: The vegetation type name (e.g. grassland and steppe, longleaf pine, yellow birch-sugar maple forest). This is more specific than the lifeform, but less specific than the ecological system (EVT Name).

-   **EVT_PHYS**: Vegetation physiognomy of the ecological system (e.g. Grassland, Riparian, Herbaceous, Sparsely Vegetated)

-   **SAF_SRM**: Society of American Foresters/Society for Range Management cover types. This cross walk is intended to help users familiar with the SAF and SRM classifications orient to the EVT types acknowledging that the classifications may not be equivalent.

-   **EVT_ORDER**: FGDC Vegetation physiognomic order (highest level/most general classification, e.g. Tree Dominated)

-   **EVT_CLASS**: FGDC Vegetation class (mid level/more specific, e.g. Closed tree canopy)

-   **EVT_SBCLS**: FGDC Vegetation subclass (lowest level/most specific, e.g. Deciduous closed tree canopy)

::: callout-tip
LANDFIRE EVT can be used at a variety of scales but should only be used after conducting a local review to confirm data accuracy. 

Caution should be taken when comparing LANDFIRE versions as attribute tables are often changed to reflect the changing needs of users.

# Where to find Existing Vegetation Type data

The Existing Vegetation Type data is included in the [Vegetation section](https://landfire.gov/vegetation) of the LANDFIRE Program Website on the [Existing Vegetation Type - Ecological Systems](https://landfire.gov/vegetation/evt) page.

On that page you will find an overview, including the information above along with further details and links to other important documents. Perhaps of most interest are the download links - via the LANDFIRE Map Viewer, full extent downloads, and a variety of ways to stream data into your maps. The page also includes resources such as attribute tables, metadata, and supplemental information.

# Some interesting uses of Existing Vegetation Type data

The EVT dataset can be used to quantify and map ecosystems, both at fine classification levels (e.g., using the EVT_NAME attribute) and coarse levels (e.g., using the EVT_PHYS attribute). This is done by clipping the data to your landscape of interest. Even more simply is to bring the data into GIS and view it! We can learn a lot about a place by simply exploring it in GIS software.

Beyond simple viewing, mapping and quantifying of ecosystems with the EVT dataset, there are many possible analyses and operations with this data including:

-   **Wildfire Exposure Risk mapping:** The basic process was developed and documented in [Beverly et al., 2021.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10980-020-01173-8) Simply stated, experts assign a probability of a vegetation type, if burning, igniting nearby vegetation through spotting, then a GIS analyst performs a focal statistics operation to calculate and map Wildfire Exposure Risk. An example of this was performed by Silas Pickhardt and Robert Zeil for the [Central Upper Peninsula Vegetation Assessment](https://conservation-data-lab.github.io/cup_assessment/fire.html).

-   **Exploring changes over time:** [Morgan et al., 2020](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s42408-019-0061-9#Abs1) explored changes in the prairie-forest ecotone in the Palouse Prairie along the border of Idaho and Washington. Authors used General Land Office survey field notes to characterize the historical landscape, then the EVT data for current. As is often done, authors grouped EVT types as needed to match the needs of their research.

-   **Using EVT to map ecosystems of interest:** A common use of the EVT data is to limit the analysis to ecosystems/places of interest. For example, [Crockett and Hurteau 2024](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s42408-024-00264-0) used this data to select pixels that were mapped as ponderosa pine, mixed conifer and sub-alpine forest types in their analysis of limiting factors of post-high severity wildfire green-up.

# Some common mistakes with EVT data

LANDFIRE EVT can be used at a variety of scales but should only be used after conducting a local review to confirm data accuracy. 

Caution should be taken when comparing LANDFIRE versions as attribute tables are often changed to reflect the changing needs of users.
