# Existing Vegetation Height
![LANDFIRE maps Existing Vegetation Height data for the entire United States, including Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. Vegetation is divided into lifeforms and then displayed with a continuous color ramp (shortest to tallest vegetation) within each lifeform.](images/EVH_map.bmp){fig-alt="A map of LANDFIRE Existing Vegetation Height for the Contiguous US, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands."}

[LANDFIREâ€™s Existing Vegetation Height dataset](https://www.landfire.gov/vegetation/evh), also known as EVH, works in tandem with the Existing Vegetation Type dataset to give a more detailed picture of the current vegetation on a landscape. EVH represents the average height of the dominant vegetation for a 30-m cell.

EVH is generated separately for tree, shrub, and herbaceous cover lifeforms using training data and other geospatial layers. Decision tree relationships are used to generate lifeform specific height class layers, which are merged into a single composite EVH layer.

LANDFIRE uses EVH in several subsequent layers, including the development of the fuels products.

## Key EVH Attributes include:

-   **CLASSNAMES**: The main attribute of EVH. This combines the EVT lifeform with the average heightof the dominant lifeform. Key lifeforms are described below. As with all LANDFIRE layers, you can get more information about individual attributes from the [EVH Attribute Data Dictionary](https://landfire.gov/sites/default/files/DataDictionary/LF2023/LF23_EVHADD_240.pdf) (opens a pdf).
    - **Tree Height**: average tree height in meters
    - **Shrub Height**: average shrub height in meters
    - **Herb Height**: average herb/grass height in meters
    - **Developed-Upland Forest**: Five classes of developed upland forest
    - **Developed**: Seven classes of developed landscapes
    - **Developed-Roads**: Pixels identified as roads
    - **NASS Crops**: Ten classes of National Agricultural Statistics Service defined cropland
    
# Where to find Existing Vegetation Height data

The Existing Vegetation Height data is included in the [Vegetation section](https://landfire.gov/vegetation) of the LANDFIRE Program Website on the [Existing Vegetation Height](https://landfire.gov/vegetation/evh) page.

On that page you will find an overview, including the information above along with further details and links to other important documents. Perhaps of most interest are the download links - via the LANDFIRE Map Viewer, full extent downloads, and a variety of ways to stream data into your maps. The page also includes resources such as attribute tables, metadata, and supplemental information.

# Some uses for Existing Vegetation Height data

Alone the EVH dataset can be used to simply map and quantify vegetation height. This is simply done by clipping the data to your landscape of interest. Even more simple is to bring the data into GIS and view it! We can learn a lot about a place by simply exploring in GIS software.

Beyond simple viewing, mapping and quantifying of ecosystems with the EVH dataset, there are many possible analyses and operations with this data including:

- [Heeren et al., (2023)](https://www.mdpi.com/2571-6255/6/12/474) developed a model to map wildfire structure defensibility, using LANDFIRE Existing Vegetation Height (and other LANDFIRE) datasets. As delivered the dataset represents the average height of a lifeform. The authors did not need lifeform so wrangled the data into a continuous height dataset that did not have herbaceous, shrub or tree modifiers.

- In an exploration of how targeted cattle grazing might impact vegetation of a wetland habitat area, [Balaji et al., (2023)](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20230006331/downloads/2023Spring_ID_SouthernIdahoEco_TechPaper_FD_v2.pdf) of a NASA Develop team used different versions of the EVH dataset. Coupled with other datasets they were able to detect changes in vegetation due to grazing, and to develop a workflow for future monitoring.

- Landscape Assessments: We often use LANDFIRE EVH in combination with EVT and EVC to better understand landscapes using something we call landscape assessments. We will have a later section of this website specifically dedicated to how we create landscape assessments using GIS and R.

- Succession Class: EVH, once again in combination with EVT and EVC, is a key component in the way LANDFIRE creates and maps succession class. Through Succession Class, EVC contributes to the calculation of Vegetation Departure and Vegetation Condition Class. We will discuss [succession class](https://shagen37.github.io/LANDFIRE_101/LANDFIRE_Datasets/1_Vegetation/Succession_Class/1-succession-class.html) and [vegetation departure](https://shagen37.github.io/LANDFIRE_101/LANDFIRE_Datasets/1_Vegetation/Vegetation_Departure/1-vegetation-departure.html) in more detail in subsequent sections of this website.
