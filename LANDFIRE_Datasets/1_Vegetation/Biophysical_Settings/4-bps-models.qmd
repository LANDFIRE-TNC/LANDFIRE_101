# What are Biophysical Settings models, and how were they created?

LANDFIRE, in collaboration with hundreds of experts around the country, created a set of over 900 state-and-transition simulation models (STSMs, hereafter referred to as BpS Models) for ecosystems in the United States. Each LANDFIRE BpS model represents a Biophysical Setting (BpS). The BpS models, originally created in the Vegetation Dynamics Development Tool (VDDT), now updated and manipulated in the [SyncroSim](http://syncrosim/) ST-Sim package, essentially capture historical disturbance regimes and succession of each BpS. BpS model results include an estimate of the frequency and severity of fire and other disturbances, as well as how much of each succession class would have been on the landscape historically. Further, they are now a platform for: 

- Understanding historical dynamics

- Exploring how LANDFIRE got to â€˜reference conditionsâ€™

- Adding, subtracting, and modifying disturbances and succession classes to not only better understand todayâ€™s landscape, but also to look forward

To learn more about the creation of the models, see [Blankenship et al., (2021)](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ecs2.3484). For more information on working with the models, see the [Working with BpS page](https://landfirereview.org/WorkWithBpS.html) of our LANDFIRE Biophysical Settings Models and Descriptions Support website.

# Working with the Biophysical Settings Models

## Download and install SyncroSim

Installing SyncroSim on a computer with a Windows operating system is similar to installing most software, i.e., you download the application, then click to start an installer, etc. You can find the software on the [SyncroSim website](https://syncrosim.com/) - we typically accept all defaults when installing.

::: callout-warning
Installing on a governmental machine may present challenges, but approval and updates are in the works.

Running SyncroSim on a Mac is generally not recommended. For more information on this, see the [getting started documentation](https://docs.syncrosim.com/getting_started/inst_lin.html) on the SyncroSim website.

## Load all LANDFIRE BpS models using the LANDFIRE Package

ðŸ’¡ *Screenshots of the process are included below the written instructions for those who find them useful.*

While SyncroSim is powerful as downloaded, adding packages will bring even more functionality. For our work you will need to add in the ST-Sim and landfirevegmodels packages. In SyncroSim:

1.  Go to File -\> Packages. Click the Install button.

2.  From the list check the St-Sim and landfirevegmodels packages, then click OK. The install will happen automatically.

3.  Close the Packages window.

Once you have those packages installed, you are ready to bring in the LANDFIRE vegetation models. To do that will take a few steps:

::: callout-note
You will need internet access for this section.
:::

1.  Go to File -\> Newâ€¦ This will bring up a New Library window.

2.  In the New Library window highlight 'landfirevegmodels' at the top of the window, *then* select Reference Models near the bottom.

3.  Note where the Reference Models library will be saved. Change the location if needed. Hit OK, then grab a beverage or go for a walk as this will take a few minutes.

::: callout-note
An Update Library window may open once the Reference Models library is downloaded. Click Apply at the bottom of that window to proceed.
:::

Once you complete these steps, SyncroSim will have downloaded and loaded the LANDFIRE BpS Reference Condition Models library into your Library Explorer window.

## Isolate a subset of BpS models

::: callout-note
You can access a set of [downloadable instructions](https://thenatureconservancy.github.io/landfiremodels/isolateLoadModel.pdf) (pdf) and much more information on Biophysical Settings models on the LANDFIRE Vegetation Modeling website.
:::

ðŸ’¡ *Screenshots of the process are included below the written instructions for those who find them useful.*

We assume you will not want to explore all 900+ LANDFIRE models, so we outline how to subset one or more individual models below.

1.  For good luck close and re-open SyncroSim. Seriously, after installing packages and libraries some of the functions just work better if you do so.

2.  If it is not there, open the LANDFIRE BpS Reference Condition Models library by going to File -\> Open then navigating to the Reference-Condition-Models.ssim file, likely in your SyncroSim directory. You will then click Open.

3.  Once opened, the LANDFIRE BpS Reference Condition Models will be in the Library Explorer pane. You will also see, within the library, a project named Definitions and a Scenario named Reference Condition Models.

4.  Click the Reference Condition Models scenario once to highlight it.

5.  Go to Edit -\> Export LFVM Strata to bring up the selection window.

6.  Once at the Export LFVM Strata window, you will check the BpS of interest, give a file name for the new library and assign a folder that it will be saved to.

::: callout-note
We do not suggest selecting many strata at once until you are familiar with the modeling process. Stick to 1-3 initially.
:::

![*Export strata*](images/new_library_window.JPG){fig-alt="SyncroSim New Library window showing options to select a base package for your library with the landfirevegmodels package selected. At the bottom of the page you can select Reference Models and set a file name and folder to export the models to."}

## Explore the models you are interested in

ðŸ’¡ *Screenshots of the process are included below the written instructions for those who find them useful.*

OK you are doing a great job. Now you have a library with a subset of strata (i.e., BpS in this case) that you care about. Now what?

By exploring the BpS models you can learn how the modeling experts parameterized them, and more interactively see how the disturbances and states all fit together.

Start exploring:

1.  Double click on Reference Condition Models then the Transition Pathways tab.

2.  To make viewing easier go to Window -\> Arrange All.

3.  At the bottom will be tabs of all of the BpSs that are in this library. Click any one. See Transitions Pane.

4.  Click on any box to see the pathways associated with that state (i.e., succession class).

5.  If you want to run the scenario:

    -   Go to the Output Options tab within the scenario, make sure that the 'State classes every' box is set to 100 (i.e., not 1).

    -   Go to the Run Control tab and set the Total iterations to 2.

    -   In the Initial Conditions tab, insure that the Total Acres and Number of Simulation Cells boxes both have 1,000 For exploring we recommend these three steps as it will speed up your runs.

    -   In the Library Explorer highlight the scenario, then click the small green triangle at the top of the screen.

6.  Make a chart by clicking the New icon in the Charts pane, then name it appropriately. You will change some settings to get your first chart:

    -   Change Line Chart to Column Chart (top left of window)

    -   Under State Classes select Proportion

    -   Under Disaggregate by check the State Class box

    -   Under Include Data For, click State Class then select the appropriate state classes
    
::: callout-note
If you have multiple BpS, you will also want to go to and select one Model under the Include Data For dropdown
:::

    -   Click Apply

::: callout-tip
ST-Sim is stochastic, so every time a model is run the results will be slightly different. If you run a BpS model in ST-Sim, you can expect the modeled succession class percents to be within +/-5% of the values reported in the BpS description and the reference condition table.

# Some interesting uses of Biophysical Settings models

The BpS models were developed by LANDFIRE to support objectives related to mapping historical vegetation patterns and fire regimes, and for evaluating landscape conditions with the Vegetation Departure metric. Beyond LANDFIRE, the BpS models and descriptions have been used to:

- **Evaluate changes in disturbance regimes.** [Haugo and others](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ecs2.2702) used BpS models to compare current area burned to a reference condition in the northwestern U.S.

- **Represent current, desired, or future conditions.** [Costanza and others](https://www.aimspress.com/fileOther/PDF/environmental/20150205.pdf) modified 45 BpS models to represent current conditions for ecosystems in North Carolina.

- **Evaluate management actions.** [Low and others](http://appliedconservation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/JCP_v6_3_Low.pdf) modified BpS models to measure vegetation departure and evaluate the effects of various management actions.

- **Support collaborative management efforts.** [Price and others](http://faculty.nelson.wisc.edu/silbernagel/docs/Price_etal_EcoMod2012.pdf) worked with experts to modify BpS models as the foundation of a collaborative process to support conservation planning.
