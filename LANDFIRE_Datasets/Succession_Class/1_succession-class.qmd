# Succession Classes

The LANDFIRE Succession Class (SClass) product describes the current condition of vegetation in terms of species composition (leaf-form and life-form), percent cover, and the range of heights of each successional state in a Biophysical Setting. Succession classes represent vegetative states with unique dynamics related to succession or disturbances, such as structural development or fire frequency. LANDFIRE uses these classes to quantify the current landscape and compare it to historical conditions to calculate vegetation departure and condition class. Classes are labeled A-E and are defined by combinations of cover type and structural stage. 

SClass can also show uncharacteristic vegetation such as non-native plants, tree plantations, and uncharacteristic (too much or too little) canopy cover. These additional components are not part of the usual variation in the types and structures of plants in a BpS. The Succession classes don’t directly measure the fuel characteristics of the current vegetation, but they represent specific stages in plant development or how often fires and other disturbances occur and their likely impact. 

To produce SClass, [mapping rules](https://landfire.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Succession_Class_Mapping_Rules_Readme.pdf) defined by local and regional experts during the original development and subsequent review of each BpS are applied to the relevant current vegetation layers. SClass mapping rules for all natural BpS are available for [download in spreadsheet format](https://landfire.gov/sites/default/files/zip/LANDFIRE_CONUS_SClass_Mapping_Rules_08162023.zip).

It is important to understand that the Succession Class dataset alone isn’t incredibly useful. It needs to be combined with the Biophysical Settings Models and Descriptions and the Biophysical Settings spatial data and/or Existing Vegetation data in order to be meaningful. Without a deeper understanding of the underlying Biophysical Setting and its related successional states and a bigger picture of the current vegetation type, cover, and height, all succession class gives us is a letter without a lot of meaning. All these LANDFIRE datasets are mapped consistently and are meant to be used together to generate the best picture of your landscape condition in the past and present, helping you make a plan for where you want to go in the future.

## Key Succession Class attributes include:

- *Description*: LANDFIRE’s Succession Classes categorized into up to five succession classes, with each succession class defined in the corresponding Biophysical Settings model. There are two additional classes – UN for uncharacteristic native vegetation type, cover, or height; and UE for uncharacteristic species (invasive or exotic vegetation types).

# Where to find Succession Class data

The Succession Class data are included in the [Vegetation section](https://landfire.gov/vegetation) of the LANDFIRE Program Website on the [Succession Class](https://landfire.gov/vegetation/sclass) page.

On that page you will find an overview, including the information above along with further details and links to other important documents. Perhaps of most interest are the download links - via the LANDFIRE Map Viewer, full extent downloads, and a variety of ways to stream data into your maps. The page also includes resources such as attribute tables, metadata, and supplemental information.

# Using the Rules Spreadsheet in Succession Class Mapping

Mapping succession classes involves a set of rules covering all possible combinations of input variables. The process includes:

1. **Spatial Overlay:** Combining BpS, existing vegetation type, cover, and height layers to identify all possible combinations for classification.

2. **Non-Reference Rules:** Applying rules based on existing vegetation type to classify non-reference succession classes, such as burnable agriculture or uncharacteristic exotic vegetation.

3. **Reference Rules:** For remaining pixels, applying rules based on lifeform, height, and canopy cover to classify reference classes A-E or other categories like uncharacteristic native or sparse.

# A note on using Succession Class data

Using the Succession Class dataset alone can be of limited utility as pixel labels are not associated with a particular BpS in the dataset, and since succession class rules are unique to each BpS will mean different things for different areas. Succession Class B for one BpS may be totally different than Succession Class B for another. There are some exceptions where the label may be useful, such as Class A, which is always the “first” class in the successional pathway (i.e., result of a replacement disturbance) and classes UN and UE described above.

# Helpful Resources for Using Succession Classes

## How to Map Successional Stages Guide

The “[How to Map Successional Stages](https://www.conservationgateway.org/ConservationPractices/FireLandscapes/LANDFIRE/Documents/How2Sclass_March19%20FINAL.pdf)” guide provides detailed steps for mapping S-Classes and adjusting existing SClass data for local use including:

- Data Preparation: Assembling and pre-processing datasets.

- Combining Datasets: Using spatial overlays to combine BpS, existing vegetation type, cover, and height layers.

- SClass Assignments: Applying rules to assign SClasses based on canopy cover, height, and indicator species

## Visual Representation

![This figure illustrates the distribution of various succession classes within the Northern Hardwoods Biophysical Setting. Succession classes represent different stages of vegetation development, from early to late stages, indicating the progression and health of ecosystems. From Swaty, et al., 2021.](images/SClass_lfgov.bmp){fig-alt="A bar chart showing the distribution of succession classes across the northern hardwoods biophysical setting in the United States. Each bar represents a specific succession class within the ecosystem, highlighting the stages of vegetation development. Below the bar are graphics showing the various heights and cover combinations of existing vegetation type, cover, and height."}

[Swaty *et al.*, 2021](https://www.mdpi.com/1421304) provides a visual representation of LANDFIRE succession class data by displaying the distribution of different succession classes across an ecosystem. Showing the proportion of each succession class within different ecosystems helps us understand the current state and progression of vegetation in these areas. This visual representation allows for easy comparison and identification of ecosystems that may be in early, mid, or late stages of succession, highlighting areas that might need conservation or restoration efforts.

## **Modifying LANDFIRE Data Guide**

The “[Modifying LANDFIRE Geospatial Data for Local Applications](https://www.conservationgateway.org/ConservationPractices/FireLandscapes/LANDFIRE/Documents/ModifyingLF_DataGuide_V1.pdf)” guide emphasizes the importance of adapting LANDFIRE data for local contexts. Key points include:

- Data Critique and Modification: Steps for critiquing and modifying LANDFIRE data to better fit local conditions.

- Application Examples: Practical examples of how modified data can be used for specific land management objectives.

By integrating these additional insights and visual aids, the Succession Classes section can provide a more comprehensive and accessible overview for users.
