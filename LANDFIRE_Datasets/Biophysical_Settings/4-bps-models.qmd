# What are Biophysical Settings Models, and how were they created?

The LANDFIRE Program, in collaboration with hundreds of experts around the country, created a set of over 900 state-and-transition simulation models (STSMs, hereafter referred to as “BpS Models”) for ecosystems in the United States. Each LANDFIRE BpS model represents a Biophysical Setting (BpS). The BpS models, originally created in Vegetation Dynamics Development Tool (aka ‘VDDT’), now updated and manipulated in [SyncroSim](http://syncrosim/), essentially capture historical disturbance regimes and succession of each BpS, and estimate how much of each succession class would have been on the landscape historically. Further, they are now a platform for:

-   Understanding historical dynamics

-   Exploring how LANDFIRE got to ‘reference conditions’

-   Adding, subtracting, and modifying disturbances and succession classes to not only better understand today’s landscape, but also to look forward

-   To learn more about the creation of the models, see [Blankenship et al., (2021).](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ecs2.3484)

# Working with the Biophysical Settings Models

## Download and Install SyncroSim

Installing SyncroSim is similar to installing most software, i.e., you download the application, then click to start an installer, etc. You can find the software on the [SyncroSim website](https://syncrosim.com/) - we typically accept all defaults when installing.

Installing on a governmental machine may present challenges, but approval and updates are in the works.

Running SyncroSim on a Mac is generally not recommended. For more information on this, see the [getting started documentation](https://docs.syncrosim.com/getting_started/inst_lin.html) on the SyncroSim website.

## Load all LANDFIRE BpS models using the LANDFIRE Package

*Note: Screenshots of the process are included below the written instructions for those who find them useful.*
:::

While SyncroSim is powerful as downloaded, adding ‘packages’ will bring even more functionality. For our work you will need to add in the ST-Sim and landfirevegmodels packages. In SyncroSim:

1.  Go to File -\> Packages. Click the “Install” button.

2.  From the list check the “St-Sim” and “landfirevegmodels” packages, when click “OK”. The install will happen automatically.

3.  Close the “Packages” window.

4.  Once you have those packages installed, you are ready to bring in the LANDFIRE vegetation models. To do that will take a few steps:

Note: you will need internet for this section.

1.  Go to File -\> New… This will bring up a “New Library” window.

2.  In the New Library window highlight “landfirevegmodels” at the top of the window, *then* select “Reference Models” near the bottom.

3.  Note where the “Reference Models” library will be saved. Change the location if needed. Hit “OK”, then grab a beverage or go for a walk as this will take a few minutes.

:::callout
*Note: an “Update Library” window may open once the Reference Models library is downloaded. Click “Apply” at the bottom of that window to proceed.*
:::

Once you complete these steps, SyncroSim will have downloaded and loaded the LANDFIRE BpS Reference Condition Models library into your “Library Explorer” window.

## Isolate a subset of BpS model

You can access a set of [downloadable instructions](https://thenatureconservancy.github.io/landfiremodels/isolateLoadModel.pdf) (pdf) and much more information on Biophysical Settings models on the LANDFIRE Vegetation Modeling website.

We assume you will not want to explore all 900+ LANDFIRE models, so we outline how to subset one or more individual models below.

1.  For good luck close and re-open SyncroSim. Seriously, after installing packages and libraries some of the functions just work better if you do so.

2.  If it is not there, open the LANDFIRE BpS Reference Condition Models library by going to File -\> Open then navigating to the “Reference-Condition-Models.ssim” file, likely in your SyncroSim directory. You will then click “Open”.

3.  Once opened, the LANDFIRE BpS Reference Condition Models will be in the Library Explorer pane. You will also see, within the library, a “project” named “Definitions” and a “Scenaro” named “Reference Condition Models”.

4.  Click the “Reference Condition Models” scenario once to highlight it.

5.  Go to Edit -\> Export LFVM Strata to bring up the selection window.

6.  Once at the Export LFVM Strata window, you will check the BpSs of interest, give a file name for the new library and assign a folder that it will be saved to.

:::callout-note
*Note: we do not suggest selecting many strata at once until you are familiar with the modeling process. Stick to 1-3 initially.*

## Explore the models you are interested in

OK you are doing a great job. Now you have a library with a subset of strata (i.e., BpSs in this case) that you care about. Now what?

By exploring the BpS models you can learn how the modeling experts parameterized them, and more interactively see how the disturbances and states all fit together.

Start exploring:

1.  Double click on “Reference Condition Models” then the Transition Pathways tab.

2.  To make viewing easier go to Window -\> Arrange All.

3.  At the bottom will be tabs of all of the BpSs that are in this library. Click any one. See “Transitions Pane”.

4.  Click on any box to see the pathways associated with that state (i.e., succession class).

5.  If you want to run the scenario:

    -   Go to “Output Options” tab within the scenario, make sure that the “State classes every” box is set to 100 (i.e., not “1”).

    -   Go to “Run Control tab” and set the ‘Total iterations’ to 2.

    -   In the “Initial Conditions” tab, insure that the “Total Acres”and “Number of Simulation cells” boxes both have “1,000” For exploring we recommend these three steps as it will speed up your runs.

    -   In the Library Explorer highlight the scenario, then click the small green triangle at the top of the screen.

6.  Make a chart by clicking the “New” icon in the “Charts” pane, then name it appropriately. You will change some settings to get your first chart:

    -   Change Line Chart to Column Chart (top left of window)

    -   Under “State Classes” select “Proportion”

    -   Under “Disaggregate by” check the “State Class” box

    -   Under “Include Data For”, click “State Class” then select the appropriate state classes

        *Note: if you have multiple BpSs, you will also want to go to and select one “Model” under the “Include Data For” dropdown*

    -    Click “Apply"
