# What does BpS Mean?

Biophysical Settings are a foundational concept for LANDFIRE defined on the [LANDFIRE Program website](https://landfire.gov/vegetation/bps) as:

> *“…a modeled representation of the vegetation system that may have been dominant on the landscape prior to Euro-American settlement and is based on both the current biophysical environment and an approximation of modeled past disturbance regimes.”*

We like to think of the BpSs as “ecosystem habitats”, or “potential ecosystem footprints”. The BpS concept asks “where might an ecosystem occur” based on abiotic factors such as soils, surficial geology, slope and elevation as well as natural disturbance regimes.

# Why consider a landscape’s BpS in current analysis?

## Potential Natural Vegetation

This concept might be best described by [Hengl et al., (2018),](https://peerj.com/articles/5457/?ref=https%3A%2F%2Fgithubhelp.com) “Potential natural vegetation (PNV) is the vegetation cover in equilibrium with climate, that would exist at a given location if not impacted by human activities”. The BpS concept differs from PNV in a couple key ways:

-   The BpS concept includes both natural disturbances and indigenous management activities such as the use of fire, which was extensive in some areas prior to European colonization.

-   PNVs are typically ‘static’, meaning they represent one “state” which is often the ‘climax’ state. BpSs almost always include multiple “states” representing a dynamic system.

## Pre-colonization vegetation

These datasets rely on historical accounts, early land surveys and other methods such as sediment analysis to map ecosystems at a certain point in time. For example, land survey driven ecosystem maps often represent conditions as of \~ 1830s. The BpSs differ in that they:

-   do not represent a specific point in time, rather the pre-European condition generally

-   are systems with multiple classes, just like PNVs.

As you will learn in the following sections, LANDFIRE maps, describes, and models each BpS.

# **How does BpS flow through the product suite?**

Need text and/or a new graphic. Can we explain it in text? Is one of these better than the other?

They generate Fire Regime Attributes, Reference Conditions, and Historical Range of Variability. They support the creation of BpS Spatial data. In addition, Succession Class, Reference Conditions, and BpS Spatial data all combine to create LANDFIRE's vegetation departure and Vegetation Condition Class datasets."}
