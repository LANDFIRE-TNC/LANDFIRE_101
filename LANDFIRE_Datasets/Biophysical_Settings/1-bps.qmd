# What does Biophysical Settings Mean?

Biophysical Settings are a foundational concept for LANDFIRE defined on the [LANDFIRE Program website](https://landfire.gov/vegetation/bps) as:

> *“…a modeled representation of the vegetation system that may have been dominant on the landscape prior to Euro-American settlement and is based on both the current biophysical environment and an approximation of modeled past disturbance regimes.”*

We like to think of the BpSs as “ecosystem habitats”, or “potential ecosystem footprints”. The BpS concept asks “where might an ecosystem occur” based on abiotic factors such as soils, surficial geology, slope and elevation as well as natural disturbance regimes.

For more information on ecological systems in LANDFIRE, see the [LANDFIRE Vegetation Products Overview](D:/LANDFIRE/Communications/Trainings/LANDFIRE101/R-Code/LANDFIRE_101/LANDFIRE_Datasets/1_lf-data.qmd) section of this website.

# Why consider a landscape’s BpS in current analysis?

The spatial data, state and transition models and descriptions contained in LANDFIRE’s BpS products offer a comprehensive picture of historic scenarios and set the stage for understanding current, and potential future ecosystem scenarios.

Three quick reasons to use BpS:

1.  BpS represent historic patterns and functions, however when used with Succession class data, current vegetation patterns can be explored. (Resource: [Swaty et al., 2021](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/11/1/28))

2.  Coupled with local knowledge, BpS descriptions and models can augment current vegetation information to understand a landscape’s potential. (Resource: [Provencher. et al., 2021](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/9/5/79/pdf))

3.  BpS models can be modified to represent current and future scenarios given predicted changes possible under future climate scenarios. (Resource: [LANDFIRE Vegetation Modeling website](https://thenatureconservancy.github.io/landfiremodels/index.html)).

# Comparing BpS with other similar concepts

## Potential Natural Vegetation

Potential natural vegetation (PNV) refers to the type of vegetation that would naturally grow in a specific area, balanced with the local climate, if there were no human interference. ([Hengl et al., 2018](https://peerj.com/articles/5457/?ref=https%3A%2F%2Fgithubhelp.com)) “Potential natural vegetation (PNV) is the vegetation cover in equilibrium with climate, that would exist at a given location if not impacted by human activities”. The BpS concept differs from PNV in two key ways:

-   PNVs examine vegetation that might exist without any human intervention. The BpS concept includes natural disturbances and indigenous management activities prior to European colonization.

-   PNVs are typically ‘static’, meaning they represent one “state” which is often the ‘climax’ state. BpS almost always includes multiple “states” representing a dynamic system.

## Pre-colonization vegetation

These datasets rely on historical accounts, early land surveys and other methods such as sediment analysis to map ecosystems at a certain point in time. For example, land survey driven ecosystem maps often represent conditions as of \~ 1830s. The BpSs differ in that they:

-   do not represent a specific point in time, rather the pre-European condition generally, and

-   are systems with multiple classes.

## Environmental Site Potential

Sometimes, people use LANDFIRE’s Environmental Site Potential (ESP) dataset when they should probably use BpS.

We realize that there is a natural confusion here, as often people are looking for what they view as “potential vegetation” or “vegetation that was once present at a site and hopefully could be again”. However, LANDFIRE created the [Environmental Site Potential](https://landfire.gov/vegetation/esp) as a precursor to BpS data to represent “the vegetation that could be supported at a given site based on the biophysical environment”.

While ESP is useful for some situations, the documentation for BpS is much more developed, and this concept is now thought of as artificial, as it represents conditions *without* disturbance, whereas the BpS data include natural disturbances.

# How does BpS flow through the product suite?

The process of integrating Biophysical Settings (BpS) into our product suite begins with the development of [BpS Models and Descriptions](https://www.landfire.gov/vegetation/bps-models). These models provide a foundational understanding of the ecological characteristics and dynamics of different vegetation types.

From these models, we generate [Succession Class](https://www.landfire.gov/vegetation/sclass) information and establish [Reference Conditions](https://www.landfire.gov/sites/default/files/zip/LANDFIRE_CONUS_Reference_Condition_Table_August_2020.zip) (downloads a 19KB zip file) that represent the Historical Range of Variability. These reference conditions are crucial for understanding the natural variability and resilience of ecosystems.

Next, we create [BpS Spatial Data](https://www.landfire.gov/vegetation/bps), which maps the distribution of these biophysical settings across the landscape. This spatial data is supported by Fire Regime Attributes, which describe the natural fire regimes associated with each BpS.

The integration of BpS spatial data and fire regime attributes leads to the development of [Vegetation Departure](https://www.landfire.gov/vegetation/vdep) and [Vegetation Condition Class](https://www.landfire.gov/vegetation/vcc) metrics. These metrics help assess the current state of vegetation compared to historical conditions, providing insights into ecological health and management needs.

Additionally, the BpS models and fire regime attributes contribute to the creation of the Fire Behavior and Fuels Modeling (FBFM) Ruleset, which guides the application of fire and vegetation management practices.

The BpS Code serves as a crucial link connecting the various datasets within the LANDFIRE Biophysical Settings (BpS) framework. This interconnected framework ensures that all aspects of biophysical settings are comprehensively analyzed and utilized, supporting effective ecological management and planning. 

# A note about map zones

Map zones in LANDFIRE are created through a collaborative effort involving multiple organizations including USGS, US DOI, USDA Forest Service and TNC. Map zones are important for LANDFIRE because they divide the landscape into manageable sections, ensuring consistent data collection and analysis including modeling vegetation and fire and fuels behavior. Each map zone represents distinct ecological regions, helping to depict reference conditions and natural plant communities that existed historically.
