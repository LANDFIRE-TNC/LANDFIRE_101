# What you will learn here

The Reference Conditions Table (RCT) is essentially an output from the Biophysical Settings Models that focuses specifically on succession class and fire regime. In this section we will:

-   Explore the fields in the RCT

-   Discuss how the RCT is linked to BpS through SClass

-   Consider RCT use cases

-   Explain where to get the table

# The Reference Conditions Table

::: callout-note
üí° We suggest you review the content on Biophysical Settings, specifically the Biophysical Settings Spatial Data page where we discuss BpS attributes, before you work through this material. We discuss Succession Class in more detail in a later section of this website.
:::

The RCT as downloaded is a .csv file with the following fields:

1.  Biophysical Settings identifiers:

    -   BpS_Code

    -   BpS_Name

    -   Model_Code

2.  Succession Class Reference Percents, Classes A ‚Äì E, e.g., ‚ÄòClassA_ReferencePercent‚Äô

3.  Fire Return Intervals, e.g., ‚ÄòFRI_ReplacementFire‚Äô

4.  Percent of fires, surface, mixed and replacement, e.g., ‚ÄòPercentOfFires_ReplacementFire‚Äô

5.  Fire Regime Group: FRG_New

# Linking the Succession Class Letter with the BpS Description Document

The LANDFIRE Succession Class (SClass) product characterizes current vegetation conditions based on existing vegetation cover, height, and species composition within each Biophysical Setting (BpS). It is used to display the current location of reference vegetation states and uncharacteristic states. Reference states are identified by a letter (A-E) and represent different stages of vegetation development. Non-reference states are represented by the codes UE, uncharacteristic exotic, and UN, Uncharacteristic Native. The uncharacteristic classes are not found within the reference condition defined for a BpS, but they may be present on the current landscape. The BpS description document describes the reference states and provides a set of mapping rules for the reference and uncharacteristic native states.

## How Succession Class Letters are Linked to BpS Description Documents

1.  **Succession Class Definition**: Each Succession Class letter corresponds to a specific combination of vegetation cover type and structural stage within a BpS. These combinations are detailed in the BpS description documents in the ‚ÄúSuccession Classes‚Äù section.
2.  **Mapping Rules:** The BpS description documents include mapping rules that define how current vegetation conditions are classified into Succession Classes. These rules consider factors such as vegetation height, canopy cover, and species composition. The rules are applied to geospatial layers of existing vegetation to map the current extent of each Succession Class. More detailed rule sets are available in the [Succession Class mapping rules spreadsheet](https://www.landfire.gov/sites/default/files/zip/LANDFIRE_CONUS_SClass_Mapping_Rules_08162023.zip) (downloads a zip file).
3.  **Reference Conditions:** The BpS description documents also provide the reference amount for each Succession Class, which can be compared to current vegetation conditions. This comparison helps in assessing vegetation departure and condition class. Reference conditions are also available in the [reference conditions table](https://www.landfire.gov/sites/default/files/zip/LANDFIRE_CONUS_Reference_Condition_Table_August_2020.zip) (downloads a zip file).
4.  **State-and-Transition Models:** The Succession Class letters are linked to state-and-transition models that simulate the growth and disturbance dynamics within each BpS. The parameters for the models are in the ‚ÄúModel Parameters‚Äù section of the BpS Description and in the BpS Model library. These models provide a quantitative representation of how vegetation transitions between different Succession Classes over time.

By linking the Succession Class letters to the detailed descriptions and mapping rules in the BpS documents, LANDFIRE ensures that the classification of vegetation conditions is both accurate and consistent with ecological principles.

# Some common uses of the Reference Conditions Table

This table can be a quick way to get reference percentages and to understand overall historical fire dynamics of BpSs. We use the RCT to:

-   Get reference succession class percentages when making charts such as the demo figure inserted below. This figure depicts reference vs. current succession classes for the Southern Rockies ecoregion and could be helpful when thinking about the major Biophysical Settings on a landscape and how their succession classes may (or may not) have changed over time.

![*Reference vs. current succession classes for the Southern Rockies ecoregion.*](images/RCT_ReferencePercents.png){fig-alt="Six separate bar charts showing Succession classes (A, B, C, D, E, UN, UE, Agriculture, Developed) on the Y axis and present and past amounts of each class on the x axis. These charts analyze six different Biophysical Settings to compare past and current successional classes on this landscape."}

-   Understand the relative proportion of surface, mixed, and replacement fire severity for a given Biophysical Setting.

-   Compare fire frequency, severity, and fire regime between Biophysical Settings.

-   Quickly calculate estimated historical annual acres burned.

-   **Quantify the amount of a BpS on the landscape**: Let ( A ) represent the acres of the landscape. For example, ( A = 200,000 ) acres.

-   **Quantify the return interval:** Let ( R ) be the return interval. For this example, ( R = 25 ), so the annual probability ( P ) is given by: P = 1/R = 1/25 = 0.04

-   **Calculate the Area Affected by Surface Fire**: You multiply the acres on the landscape by the return interval. The area affected ( S ) can be calculated as: S=A√óP

-   Putting it all together, the equation becomes:

    S=200,000√ó(0.04)=8,000 acres of surface fire

The following chart depicts annual acres burned, all fire types, for the most dominant BpSs of the Southern Rockies.

The reference conditions table is important in landscape assessments and LANDFIRE‚Äôs vegetation departure, both of which we will discuss more in-depth in future sections of this learning website.

# Where to find the Reference Conditions Table

The RCT is downloadable on the [Bps Models page of the LANDFIRE Program website](https://landfire.gov/vegetation/bps-models). Scroll down to the ‚ÄúDownload BpS Models and Descriptions‚Äù section, then click ‚ÄúReference Conditions‚Äù which will begin an immediate download. Unless you specify the download location, the file will likely end up in your default Downloads folder.

To access the file, open the .csv in Excel, R, or any other program you use to view .csv files.
