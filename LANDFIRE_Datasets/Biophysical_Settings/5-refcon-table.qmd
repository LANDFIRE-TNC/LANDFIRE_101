# What you will learn here

The Reference Conditions Table (RCT) is essentially an output from the Biophysical Settings Models that focuses specifically on succession class and fire regime. In this section we will:

-   Explore the fields in the RCT

-   Discuss RCT use cases

-   Explain where to get the table

# The Reference Conditions Table

:::callout-note
üí° We suggest you review the content on Biophysical Settings, specifically the Biophysical Settings Spatial Data page where we discuss BpS attributes, before you work through this material. We discuss Succession Class in more detail in a later section of this website.
:::

The RCT as downloaded is a .csv file with the following fields:

1.  Biophysical Settings identifiers:

    -   BpS_Code

    -   BpS_Name

    -   Model_Code

2.  Succession Class Reference Percents, Classes A ‚Äì E, e.g., ‚ÄòClassA_ReferencePercent‚Äô

3.  Fire Return Intervals, e.g., ‚ÄòFRI_ReplacementFire‚Äô

4.  Percent of fires, surface, mixed and replacement, e.g., ‚ÄòPercentOfFires_ReplacementFire‚Äô

5.  Fire Regime Group: FRG_New

# Some common uses of the Reference Conditions Table

This table can be a quick way to get reference percentages and to understand overall historical fire dynamics of BpSs. We use the RCT to:

-   Get reference succession class percentages when making charts such as the demo figure inserted below. This figure depicts reference vs. current succession classes for the Southern Rockies ecoregion and could be helpful when thinking about the major Biophysical Settings on a landscape and how their succession classes may (or may not) have changed over time.

-   Understand the relative proportion of surface, mixed, and replacement fire severity for a given Biophysical Setting.

-   Compare fire frequency, severity, and fire regime between Biophysical Settings.

These charts analyze six different Biophysical Settings to compare past and current successional classes on this landscape."}

-   Quickly calculate estimated historical annual acres burned.

-   **Quantify the amount of a BpS on the landscape**: Let ( A ) represent the acres of the landscape. For example, ( A = 200,000 ) acres.

-   **Quantify the return interval:** Let ( R ) be the return interval. For this example, ( R = 25 ), so the annual probability ( P ) is given by: P = 1/R = 1/25 = 0.04

-   **Calculate the Area Affected by Surface Fire**: You multiply the acres on the landscape by the return interval. The area affected ( S ) can be calculated as:

    S=A√óP

-   Putting it all together, the equation becomes:

    S=200,000√ó(0.04)=8,000 acres of surface fire

-   The following chart depicts annual acres burned, all fire types, for the most dominant BpSs of the Southern Rockies.

The reference conditions table is important in landscape assessments and LANDFIRE‚Äôs vegetation departure, both of which we will discuss more in-depth in future sections of this learning website.

# Where to find the Reference Conditions Table

The RCT is downloadable on the [Bps Models page of the LANDFIRE Program website](https://landfire.gov/vegetation/bps-models). Scroll down to the ‚ÄúDownload BpS Models and Descriptions‚Äù section, then click ‚ÄúReference Conditions‚Äù which will begin an immediate download. Unless you specify the download location, the file will likely end up in your default Downloads folder.

To access the file, open the .csv in Excel, R, or any other program you use to view .csv files.
