## About Biophysical Settings

LANDFIRE’s Biophysical Settings data, also known as BpS, represents the vegetation system that may have been dominant on the landscape prior to European colonization and is based on both the current biophysical environment and an approximation of the historical disturbance regime. LANDFIRE uses BpS to depict reference conditions of vegetation across landscapes.

As of 2016, BpS now includes information on the historical fire regime, such as fire return intervals, percent of fire severities, and fire regime groups. Since LANDFIRE’s fire regime information is based on the historic context, we include it with BpS to provide a better picture of the pre-colonization landscape to the best of our knowledge.

The Biophysical Settings attributes correspond with the information in the Biophysical Settings Descriptions discussed in the [BpS Description](bps-description.html) section of this website. We suggest that you review this information for a more complete understanding of the Biophysical Settings attributes.

For even more information, we’ve created this short [BpS 101 video](https://youtu.be/xjaWJCe7udQ) on YouTube (3 minutes ).

### Key BpS Attributes include

-   *BPS_CODE*: The unique code LANDFIRE uses for each Biophysical Setting
-   *Zone*: The NLCD map zone(s) the Bps is located in or relates to
-   *BPS_MODEL*: The unique BpS Model code. This combines the BpS code with the zone(s) the model is located in. In some cases, a BpS with the same name and BpS Code may be split among map zones because the vegetation or disturbance regimes vary enough that the descriptions differ. An example of this is the ‘Laurentian-Acadian Northern Hardwoods forest’ BpS (13020), which has four different BpS Models, although it is mapped as one BpS type. (See the screenshot below.)
-   *BPS_NAME*: The name of the Biophysical Setting. The name is matched to the BpS Code, not the BpS model number.
-   *GROUPVEG*: Coarse vegetation type groupings highlighting the high-level dominant vegetation within that BpS. Note that if a BpS is listed as ‘Hardwood’ it may actually be a mix of hardwood, herbaceous, savannah, and more, but LANDFIRE’s mapping identified hardwoods as dominating most of the landscape.
-   Fire Regime Attributes
    -   *FRI_REPLAC*: Average historic replacement-severity fire frequency for the BpS
    -   *FRI_MIXED*: Average historic mixed-severity fire frequency for the BpS
    -   *FRI_SURFAC*: Average historic surface-severity fire frequency for the BpS
    -   *FRI_ALLFIR*: Average historic fire frequency for all fires within the BpS
    -   *PRC_REPLAC*: Percent of historic fires with replacement severity for the BpS
    -   *PRC_MIXED*: Percent of historic fires with mixed serverity for the BpS
    -   *PRC_SURFAC*: Percent of historic fires with surface severity for the BpS
    -   *FRG_NEW*: The fire regime group this BpS is found in. Fire regime groups are based on a combination of fire return interval and fire severity. The current Fire Regime Groups were updated in 2016, and have been modified from a previous classification. You can find the new breakdown of fire regime groups in the [Attribute Data Dictionary](https://landfire.gov/sites/default/files/DataDictionary/LF2020/LF20_BPSADD_220.pdf) for the BpS spatial data.
        -   Fire Regime Groups are assigned as follows:
            -   *I-A (1A)*: Percent replacement fire less than 66.7%, fire return interval 0-5 years
            -   *I-B (1B)*: Percent replacement fire less than 66.7%, fire return interval 6-15 years
            -   *I-C (1C)*: Percent replacement fire less than 66.7%, fire return interval 16-35 years
            -   *II-A (2A)*: Percent replacement fire greater than 66.7%, fire return interval 0-5 years
            -   *II-B (2B)*: Percent replacement fire greater than 66.7%, fire return interval 6-15 years
            -   *II-C (2C)*: Percent replacement fire greater than 66.7%, fire return interval 16-35 years
            -   *III-A (3A)*: Percent replacement fire less than 80%, fire return interval 36-100 years
            -   *III-B (3B)*: Percent replacement fire less than 66.7%, fire return interval 101-200 years
            -   *IV-A (4A)*: Percent replacement fire greater than 80%, fire return interval 36-100 years
            -   *IV-B (4B)*: Percent replacement fire greater than 66.7%, fire return interval 101-200 years
            -   *V-A (5A)*: Any severity, fire return interval 201-500 years
            -   *V-B (5B)*: Any severity, fire return interval 501 or more years

## Where to find BpS data

The Biophysical Settings data is included in the [Vegetation section](https://landfire.gov/vegetation/bps) of the LANDFIRE Program Website on the [Biophysical Settings page](https://landfire.gov/vegetation/bps). Here you will find an overview, including the information above along with further details and links to other important documents. Perhaps of most interest are the download links - via the LANDFIRE Map Viewer, full extent downloads, and a variety of ways to stream data into your maps. NOTE: We will include more detail on the differences between these download methods and how to access data via each method in subsequent sections of this website. The page also includes resources such as attribute tables, metadata, and supplemental information.

## Some common mistakes with BpS data

### Using LANDFIRE’s Environmental Site Potential dataset

Sometimes, people use LANDFIRE’s Environmental Site Potential (ESP) dataset when they should probably use BpS. We realized that there is a natural confusion here, as often people are looking for what they view as “potential vegetation” or “vegetation that was once present at a site and hopefully could be again”. However, LANDFIRE created the Environmental Site Potential as a precursor to BpS data represent “the vegetation that could be supported at a given site based on the biophysical environment” (from https://landfire.gov/vegetation/esp).

While ESP is useful for some situations, the documentation for BpS is much more developed, and this concept is now thought of as artificial, as it represents conditions *without* disturbance, whereas the BpS data include natural disturbances.
