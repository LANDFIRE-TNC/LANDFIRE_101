[![LANDFIRE delivers Biophysical Settings data and models for the entire United States, including Alaska and Hawaii. Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands do not have BpS data developed. 950 Biophysical Settings are grouped into seven major vegetation classes and displayed using one color family for each class.](images/BpS_map.bmp){fig-alt="A map of the Biophysical Settings data for the Contiguous United States, Alaska, and Hawaii." fig-align="center"}](https://landfire.gov/vegetation/bps-models)

# About Biophysical Settings Spatial Products

LANDFIRE’s Biophysical Settings spatial product, also known as BpS, is a spatial representation of the BpS concept we discussed in the [previous section](D:/LANDFIRE/Communications/Trainings/LANDFIRE101/R-Code/LANDFIRE_101/LANDFIRE_Datasets/Biophysical_Settings/1-bps.qmd). LANDFIRE uses BpS to depict reference conditions of vegetation across landscapes.

Beginning with LF2016, Historic Fire Regime information (pre-European colonization fire return intervals, percent of fire severities, and fire regime groups) were delivered by LANDFIRE as attributes of the BpS spatial layer instead of as separate spatial layers. Since LANDFIRE’s fire regime information is based on the historical context, we included it with BpS to provide a better picture of the pre-colonization landscape. However, in version LF2023 and beyond LANDFIRE will again deliver pre-European colonization information as three separate spatial layers along with the fully attributed BpS spatial layer. These layers are pre-European colonization Fire Regime Group, Fire Return Intervals (for Low, Moderate and Replacement severities) and Percent Fire Severity (for Low, Moderate and Replacement fires).

The Biophysical Settings attributes correspond with the information in the Biophysical Settings Descriptions discussed in the [BpS Documents](D:/LANDFIRE/Communications/Trainings/LANDFIRE101/R-Code/LANDFIRE_101/LANDFIRE_Datasets/Biophysical_Settings/3-bps_documents.qmd)section of this website. We suggest that you review this information for a more complete understanding of the Biophysical Settings attributes.

For even more information, we’ve created this short [BpS 101 video](https://youtu.be/xjaWJCe7udQ) on YouTube (3 minutes ).

## Key BpS Attributes include

-   **BPS_CODE:** The unique code LANDFIRE uses for each Biophysical Setting

-   **Zone:** The NLCD map zone(s) the Bps is located in or relates to

-   **BPS_MODEL:** The unique BpS Model code. This combines the BpS code with the zone(s) the model is located in. In some cases, a BpS with the same name and BpS Code may be split among map zones because the vegetation or disturbance regimes vary enough that the descriptions differ. An example of this is the ‘Laurentian-Acadian Northern Hardwoods forest’ BpS (13020), which has four different BpS Models, although it is mapped as one BpS type:

    -   13020_40 (BpS 13020, Map Zone 40)
    -   13020_63 (BpS 13020, Map Zone 40)
    -   13020_65_66 (BpS 13020, Map Zone 65 and 66)
    -   13020_65_66 (BpS 13020, Map Zone 65 and 66)

Note, there will be a separate row, and VALUE for each BPS_CODE/MapZone combination, such as presented in the above example where there are two rows for 13020_65_66.

-   **BPS_NAME:** The name of the Biophysical Setting. The name is matched to the BpS Code, not the BpS model number.

-   **GROUPVEG:** Coarse vegetation type groupings highlighting the high-level dominant vegetation within that BpS. Note that if a BpS is listed as ‘Hardwood’ it may actually be a mix of hardwood, herbaceous, savannah, and more, but LANDFIRE’s mapping identified hardwoods as dominating most of the landscape.

-   **Pre-European Colonization Fire Regime Attributes:**

    -   *FRI_REPLAC*: Average historic replacement-severity fire frequency for the BpS
    -   *FRI_MIXED*: Average historic mixed-severity fire frequency for the BpS
    -   *FRI_SURFAC*: Average historic surface-severity fire frequency for the BpS
    -   *FRI_ALLFIR*: Average historic fire frequency for all fires within the BpS.
    -   *PRC_REPLAC*: Percent of historic fires with replacement severity for the BpS
    -   *PRC_MIXED*: Percent of historic fires with mixed serverity for the BpS
    -   *PRC_SURFAC*: Percent of historic fires with surface severity for the BpS
    -   *FRG_NEW*: The fire regime group this BpS is found in. Fire regime groups are based on a combination of fire return interval and fire severity. The current Fire Regime Groups were updated in 2016 and have been modified from a previous classification. You can find the new breakdown of fire regime groups in the [Attribute Data Dictionary](https://landfire.gov/sites/default/files/DataDictionary/LF2020/LF20_BPSADD_220.pdf)for the BpS spatial data.


# Where to find BpS data

The Biophysical Settings data is included in the [Vegetation section](https://landfire.gov/vegetation/bps) of the LANDFIRE Program Website on the [Biophysical Settings page](https://landfire.gov/vegetation/bps). Here you will find an overview, including the information above along with further details and links to other important documents. Perhaps of most interest are the download links - via the LANDFIRE Map Viewer, full extent downloads, and a variety of ways to stream data into your maps. The page also includes resources such as attribute tables, metadata, and supplemental information.

NOTE: In a later section of this site, you will learn more about the differences between these download methods and how to access data via each method.
