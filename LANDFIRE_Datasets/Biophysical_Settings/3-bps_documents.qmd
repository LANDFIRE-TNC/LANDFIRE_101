# Biophysical Settings Descriptions

The Biophysical Settings (BpS) Descriptions are a foundational LANDFIRE product. They set the stage for development of many other LANDFIRE products such as the Biophysical Settings and Succession Class spatial datasets.

# What you will learn here:

-   How to download all (or some) of the BpS Descriptions

-   The importance of map zones

-   The concept of BpS and succession class

-   How LANDFIRE documented ‚Äòreference conditions‚Äô (i.e., how our BpSs looked and functioned prior to European colonization)

-   What is contained in the BpS descriptions

# Downloading all of the BpS descriptions

While we typically work with one or a small set of BpSs, there are times when downloading the entire set developed for the lower 48 states plus Hawaii and Alaska is most efficient.

## To download all BpS descriptions

üí° *Screenshots are provided below for those who want them.*

1.  Navigate to the [Biophysical Settings Models and Descriptions page](https://landfire.gov/vegetation/bps) of the LANDFIRE Program website (Vegetation‚Üí Biophysical Settings Models and Descriptions).

2.  Scroll down to the Download BpS Models and Descriptions Section near the bottom of the page.

3.  Here you will see two options: ‚ÄúRevised CONUS and Hawaii‚Äù models and ‚ÄúOriginal Alaska‚Äù models. Select whichever set you would like, then click on the ‚ÄúBpS Descriptions‚Äù which will trigger downloading of a .zip file named ‚ÄúLANDFIRE_CONUS-HI_BpS_Descriptions_Jan2023.zip‚Äù (for Revised CONUS and Hawaii) that has 819 Word documents or ‚ÄúAlaska_Original_BpS_Descriptions.zip‚Äù (for Alaska) that has 12 pdf documents. This file will most likely land in your ‚ÄúDownloads‚Äù directory.

4.  Use your extraction tool of choice to unzip and explore. One possible way if you are using Windows is to:

    -   right click the file

    -   select ‚ÄòExtract all‚Äô to access the Windows extraction tool.

# Downloading one or a set of BpS documents

üí° *Screenshots are provided below for those who want them.*

In support of a BpS review process we completed recently, we created a [BpS Models and Descriptions Support](https://landfirereview.org/)website, which has a page that allows for searching for, and downloading a single or a set of BpS Descriptions.

## First, select your BpSs of interest

-   Go to [the search page](https://landfirereview.org/search.php).

-   From here, there are multiple ways to select BpS documents to download:

    1.  Use the filters on the left side of the page:

        -   Use the checkboxes under the ‚ÄúVegetation Types‚Äù heading to select all BpS documents for one or more broad Vegetation Types (#1 on ‚ÄòWays to select‚Äô screenshot below)

        -   Use the checkboxes under the ‚ÄúMap Zone‚Äù heading to select all BpS documents for one or more LANDFIRE Map Zones (#2 on ‚ÄòWays to select‚Äô screenshot below).

            -   To get a Map Zone map you can click the ‚ÄúView map of LANDFIRE Map Zones‚Äù text (highlighted with blue arrow on ‚ÄòWays to download‚Äô screenshot below), or [access it directly](https://landfirereview.org/IMG/USmapzones-v1_July2015.jpg) (opens a .jpg file).

    2.  Search for a BpS of interest by typing in the ‚ÄòSearch‚Ä¶‚Äô box (#3 on ‚ÄòWays to select‚Äô screenshot below). A few things to keep in mind when searching:

        -   You can search by genus and/or species or common name (e.g., ‚ÄòFraxinus‚Äô, or ‚ÄòWhite Ash‚Äô )

        -   Most text terms will work, numbers will not. For example, ‚Äòhurricane‚Äô will return BpSs, ‚Äò1362‚Äô (an actual BpS number) will not.

        -   You can first filter by ‚ÄòVegetation Types‚Äô and/or ‚ÄòMap Zones‚Äô, then search to narrow results.

## Download documents of interest

Once you have selected the BpSs you want to get descriptions for you must take one more step to get your documents:

1.  If you want all of the BpSs for selected ‚ÄòVegetation Types‚Äô and/or ‚ÄòMap Zones‚Äô you will click the ‚ÄòDownload All Search Results Documents‚Äô button (indicated with arrow on ‚ÄòDownload all‚Äô screenshot below).

2.  If you have checked specific BpSs for download, you will click the ‚ÄòDownload All Selected Documents‚Äô button (indicated with an arrow on ‚ÄòDownload selected‚Äô screenshot below).

::: callout-note
üí° Clicking either of the ‚ÄòDownload‚Äô buttons will initiate download of a .zip file that will most likely land in your ‚ÄòDownloads‚Äô folder. Use your extraction tool of choice to unzip and explore.
:::

::: callout-warning
‚ö†Ô∏è Beware when clicking the ‚ÄòDownload All Search Results Documents‚Äô button. If not careful you will end up with a huge download of many more documents than you want! Make sure to filter by ‚ÄòVegetation Types‚Äô and/or ‚ÄòMap Zones‚Äô first.

# What‚Äôs in a BpS document

Once you download and unzip your selected BpS documents, what do you actually have? Inside the zip file, you will find one or more Word documents that in very general terms describe how the ecosystems of the US ‚Äòlooked and functioned‚Äô prior to European colonization. We hope the documents are largely self-explanatory. That said, below we‚Äôll highlight a few important considerations when reading these documents.

## File name, Map Zones and that number at the top

The BpS documents were saved with a numeric code such as ‚Äú13700_60_63_64_65_66.docx‚Äù. This number represents three things:

1.  BpS code: this is the first 4 digits, e.g., ‚Äú1370‚Äù in our example for the ‚ÄúAppalachian (Hemlock-)Northern Hardwood Forest‚Äù.

2.  BpS splits: this is the fifth digit, or ‚Äú0‚Äù in our example. Occasionally an original BpS would be ‚Äòsplit‚Äô into multiple. For example, in the Great Lakes there is a ‚ÄúBoreal White Spruce-Fir-Hardwood Forest - Inland‚Äù (BpS code 13651), and a ‚ÄúBoreal White Spruce-Fir-Hardwood Forest - Coastal‚Äù (BpS code 13652), which have a ‚Äú1‚Äù and a ‚Äú2‚Äù in the file name, and BpS code.

3.  Map Zones: the string of numbers separated by an underscore represents the Map Zones that this particular document (and associated BpS state and transition model) apply to.

üí° **Why are Map Zones important?**

Map zones in LANDFIRE are created through a collaborative effort involving multiple organizations including USGS, US DOI, USDA Forest Service and TNC. Map zones are important for LANDFIRE because they divide the landscape into manageable sections, ensuring consistent data collection and analysis including modeling vegetation and fire and fuels behavior. Each map zone represents distinct ecological regions, helping to depict reference conditions and natural plant communities that existed historically.

## Fire Frequency Table

The Fire Frequency Table can be confusing. A few things to keep in mind when viewing this table include:

-   The Severity, Avg FI (FI - Fire Interval), and Percent of All Fires values are imported from the Syncro Sim model

-   The values in the Avg FI and Percent of All Fires columns are essentially a ‚Äòcomposite‚Äô across all succession classes, which may include classes which have very short FIs, and classes with very long FIs.

-   The Min FI and Max FI columns are user populated, and may not necessarily correspond to the Avg FI and Percent of All Fires columns.

An example Fire Frequency table is replicated below.

| Severity         | Avg FI | Percent of All Fires | Min FI | Max FI |
|------------------|--------|----------------------|--------|--------|
| Replacement      | 1005   | 53                   |        |        |
| Moderate (Mixed) | 1118   | 47                   |        |        |
| Low (Surface)    |        |                      |        |        |
| All Fires        | 529    | 100                  |        |        |

Fire interval is expressed in years for each fire severity class and for all types of fire combined (All Fires). Average FI is the central tendency modeled. Percent of all fires is the percent of fires modeled in that severity class. Minimum and Maximum FIs show the relative range of fire intervals as estimated by model contributors, if known.

## Succession Classes Table

LANDFIRE did not attempt to map where succession classes were prior to European colonization, as they would have moved around. This table is used to map where succession classes are today. For example, in the ‚ÄòSuccession Class Table‚Äô below we have highlighted combinations of Existing Height and Cover (and lifeform) that would be mapped as Succession Class A.

[![](images/sclass_table.png){fig-alt="A succession class table showing the Mapping Rules, Upper Layer Lifeform (herb, shrub, or tree), the vegetation height, and several columns of canopy cover in groups of 10 (i.e. 0 - 10, 11 - 20, etc.). Below the Canopy Cover % groups is a letter corresponding to the succession class. A purple box around 6 boxes corresponding to tree 0-5m, 71-80% canopy, 81 -90% canopy, and 91 - 100% canopy and tree 5-10m with the same canopy covered percents shows that those classes should be in succession Class A." fig-align="center"}](https://landfirereview.org/search.php)

## Model Parameters Table

This table is essentially an ‚Äòexport‚Äô of the SyncroSim model parameters. In other words, experts entered in all of the natural disturbances they knew about into the modeling software, and this table has all of those disturbances, numbers and the ‚Äòresults‚Äô of those disturbances.

In the ‚ÄòModel Parameters Table‚Äô below the top row that would read something like ‚Äúthe wind/weather/stress disturbance would impact the Early1:All succession class once every 1000 years on average (or 0.1% of the succession class yearly on average), and when that disturbance happened, the vegetation would respond by returning back to the beginning of the Early1: All succession class.‚Äù

| Disturbance Type | Disturbance occurs in | Moves vegetation to | Disturbance Probability | Return Interval (yrs) | Reset Age to New Class Start Age after Disturbance? | Years Since Last Disturbance |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Wind or Weather Stress | Early1:ALL | Early1:ALL | 0.001 | 1000 | No | 0 |
| Replacement Fire | Early1:ALL | Early1:ALL | 0.001 | 1000 | Yes | 0 |
| Alternative Succession | Mid1:OPN | Late1:CLS | 1 | 1 | Yes | 100 |
| Mixed Fire | Mid1:OPN | Mid1:OPN | 0.001 | 1000 | No | 0 |
