# What is the LANDFIRE Map Viewer and how do I use it?

For many users the LANDFIRE Map Viewer (LFMV) will be the best way to get LANDFIRE data. Once you get the knack of it, obtaining data will be quick and easy. We highlight a few tips below.

üí° *Screenshots of this process are provided below for those who find them useful.*

1. First, navigate to the [LANDFIRE Map Viewer](https://www.landfire.gov/viewer) from the LANDFIRE Program Website. You can access this under the Data Access heading on the product page for each LANDFIRE dataset or by clicking ‚Äú[Get Data](https://landfire.gov/data)‚Äù on the home page of the website.

Pro tip: You can also access a [User Instructions page](https://landfire.gov/data/LFViewerUserInstructions) on the LANDFIRE Program website that may provide more complete instructions than we are able to give here. You can also find help by visiting the [Map Viewer tutorial videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwRbAc4x5n944a9T1Ss84Ji8UYP_nqHXz) on our YouTube channel.

2. We like to turn off the display of LANDFIRE‚Äôs Existing Vegetation Type data so that we can see the basemap. To do this uncheck the Existing Vegetation box in the left-hand banner.

3. You will need to select an area to limit the data download. On the right banner there is a Method dropdown, with multiple options. Here we will draw a rectangle. Once your method is complete (e.g., drawing a rectangle) you will be presented with options for Projection and versions. You can change these as needed or you can accept the default projections. It is possible to select data from multiple versions.

4. After you select your area, available datasets will be listed below, nested by version and category. Narrow down the product categories to view from a drop-down list and then choose the products you like from a list of available data.

üí° Note: all datasets are not available with every version. [Visit the LANDFIRE Program Website](https://landfire.gov/data#versions) to begin learning about versions.
:::

5. Once all desired datasets are selected, scroll down to enter your e-mail address. Soon after doing that and clicking the ‚ÄúDownload‚Äù button you will receive an email announcing that your data is ready for download. Follow the instructions in that email.

After you click the ‚ÄòDownload‚Äù button on the LFMV you will eventually receive an email with instructions. The zipped data will likely land in your ‚ÄôDownloads‚Äô directory. Then what?

Essentially you will extract the data to a useful location, then begin using LANDFIRE data in your projects and analyses.
