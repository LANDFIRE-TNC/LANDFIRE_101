# Downloading LANDFIRE data with the rlandfire package by Mark Buckner

## What is the rlandfire package?

The [rlandfire](https://github.com/bcknr/rlandfire) package, developed by Dr. Mark Buckner, provides a way to access the LFPS REST API from R and download LANDFIRE products directly into your R environment. At the package page, Dr. Buckner provides instructions for basic use, and a tutorial for comparing ponderosa pine canopy cover before and after a fire.

## How can the rlandfire package be useful?

LANDFIRE-TNC often uses R code for LANDFIRE data processing and analysis. There are many cases when using the rlandfire package makes sense, including:

-   Needing to work in a reproducible manner, i.e., needing to document LF datasets used (and versions) in your code,

-   Having limited storage spaceâ€”i.e., you do not want to save relatively large CONUS-wide datasets locally,

-   Needing to update your work frequently e.g., due to updated LANDFIRE versions or multiple landscapes.

In general, by using the rlandfire package you gain some of the biggest benefits of coding: 1) documentation and 2) being able to repeat operations quickly.

## Basic framework and requirements

The basic workflow is similar across all methods. Steps include:

1.  Read in a shapefile of your Area of Interest (AoI)

2.  Determine names and list of products you need. One way to do that is to visit the [products table](https://lfps.usgs.gov/products).

3.  Create necessary and optional r objects:

    -   List of data products to download (necessary)

    -   Projection and resolution (optional)

    -   Rules, e.g., arguments that filter data

    -   Path for temporary .zip file

4.  Call the LFPS REST API

5.  Load and process the downloaded data
