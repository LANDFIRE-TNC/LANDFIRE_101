# Introduction to this site

Imagine you are Rhonda (District) Ranger. On your district are many land management challenges and opportunities including timber harvest, wildfire, fuels buildup, recreation, wildlife habitat alteration and climate change. Many of the broad goals and objectives are written in the forest plan, but you have flexibility at the project level and must decide what to do when. This is no easy task as there may be competing interests. Information alone will not solve the problem, but is necessary for documentation, trust building, and informed decision making. While LANDFIRE does not provide every single dataset, tool or model for every natural resource decision, the products typically provide a solid starting point.

Welcome to LANDFIRE 101, an introduction to the essential elements of LANDFIRE - Landscape Fire and Resource Management Planning tools - a crucial resource for land management and conservation. This platform is designed to familiarize you with the LANDFIRE Program, its comprehensive website ([landfire.gov](http://landfire.gov/)), and some of the invaluable datasets it provides.

This LANDFIRE 101 learning website serves as a supporting addendum to the comprehensive [LANDFIRE Program website](https://www.landfire.gov). The LANDFIRE 101 learning website can be followed from start-to-finish and provides practical support for new LANDFIRE users. This supporting site should be used in conjunction to (not instead of) the [LANDFIRE Program website](https://www.landfire.gov). As such, we provide essentials for getting started with using and applying LANDFIRE products and each page provides multiple opportunities for exploring these data further on the comprehensive [LANDFIRE Program website](https://www.landfire.gov).

Whether you are a novice or seeking to deepen your expertise, this training platform provides the insights and practical skills necessary for leveraging LANDFIRE data in your projects. We invite you to join us and discover how these powerful tools can support your endeavors in land management and beyond.
